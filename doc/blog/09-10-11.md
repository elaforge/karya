Today I finally completed the merged tracks implementation.  Since the merged
track is hidden, I had to implement hidden tracks too, and it was more
complicated than I thought.  Simply pretending to the UI that the track was
removed means that tracknums coming from the UI are wrong.  I could insert a
layer to correct incoming updates with tracknums based on the current hidden
tracks, but it just seemed too complicated, so I decided to implement track
collapse in the c++ layer.  I actually implemented it as collapsing to a
divider, since I was never happy with there being both hidden and collapsed
tracks.

It meant a bit of hackery because c++ has to remember the state of the
collapsed track so it can restore it.  Keeping state in c++ is a bit sketchy
because it's duplicated information and because it's internal operations
instead of the normal diff -> update -> sync avenue.  For example, what
happens if a collapsed track is resized in haskell?  When it's expanded, it
won't get the new size.  Mabybe the tracknum translation would have been
cleaner?  Oh well, I suppose I can switch back if need be.

Along the way I fixed a few long-standing bugs in how tracks are resized.
