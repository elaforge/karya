- Local style is in doc/STYLE.

- After cloning the repo, run git-hooks/install to check some local checks.

- Currently Local/* is my personal stuff, but in the future it should have
per-user local configuration.  Maybe in the future that should move to
Local.Elaforge, or keep a personal branch, or there could be some submodule
shenannigans to merge a separate repo.
