    Special Calls

" - Repeat the text of the last event.

-- - Comment, skipped by the deriver, useful to manually set a block end past
the last event.


    Typed Numbers, Typed Controls

Numeric values can have a type suffix.  For instance, 3d means that the number
is intended to be interpreted as a transposition of 3 diatonic steps.
Similarly, control names can have a type suffix, such as delay:r.  This means
that the values of the control are intended to be interpreted as 3 RealTime
seconds.

Of course, whether or not they are so interpreted depends on the call that
winds up receiving them.  Calls that expect an amount of transposition will
accept 'd' and 'c', and untyped numbers will be interpreted as 'c'
(chromatic).

Many numbers and controls are untyped and will ignore any type on a value or
control.  The type mechanism is intended only as a way of overloading certain
calls.  For example, it would be awkward to include all combinations of trills
on diatonic or chromatic neighbors, and in score time or real time.  It's
easier to have one control that can be passed a diatonic or chromatic
neighbor.

All type codes are enumerated in Derive.BaseTypes.Type.


    Built-in Controls

p - Maps to velocity for most instruments, but maps to breath for instruments
with the Pressure flag.

start-rnd, dur-rnd - Randomize note starts and durations.  It will only ever
make notes shorter to avoid causing overlaps, which thanks to MIDI can cut-off
notes prematurely.
