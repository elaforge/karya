The patchdb is a keyword oriented database for finding instruments quickly.

It has a crawl part and a search part:

    Crawl

The crawl reads from files of various types: seq instrument descriptions, maybe
wav samples + metadata, NI sound files, etc.  It extracts metadata from the
file in the form of (k, v) pairs, and adds it to the db.  It uses rsync style
checksums to avoid extracting from unchanged files.

    Search

This has a simple query language to do a fast search on the db.  It gives you
a list of results, and when you select one, emits a result-specific "show"
action, which may just be text descriptions ("set up the synth like this"), or
emit midi sysex / patch changes, or whatever.


It could equally well index mp3s or pictures or whatever.

The DB is sqlite, if I can get away with it.
