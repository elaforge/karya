    Misc things to keep in mind

Keep an eye on the cache status line in logview.  If the cache is not being
used then rederivations will start to take a long time.  For example, control
damage is expanded based on intervening control tracks because the controls
themselves may depend on the damaged control.  So a control track with very
few event (e.g. only one at 0) will cause any control damage to expand quite a
bit.
