## music

String quartets which use the VSL sample library.  They use notation to get a
somewhat realistic sound from it, with additional annotations to produce a
staff score.

- [string quartet 6](data/music/squartet6.mp3) -
    [score](data/score/squartet6.pdf)
- [string quartet spawn](data/music/squartet-spawn.mp3) -
    [score](data/score/squartet-spawn.pdf)
- [Viola sonata](data/music/viola-sonata.mp3) -
    [score](data/score/viola-sonata.pdf)

- [hedge maze](data/music/hedge-maze.mp3)

These use guzheng notation which simulates hand placement and open string
restrictions charactistic of the instrument.

- [Concert gift](data/music/concert gift-快版本.mp3) -
    [score](data/score/concert-gift.pdf)
- [古箏、揚琴 - 14-06-16](data/music/古箏、揚琴 - 14-06-16.mp3)
- [zheng experiments](data/music/zheng experiments.mp3)

Electronic scores which experiment with algorithmically generated scales, and
expressive notation for pitch and dynamic curves.

- [Five Hexanies](data/music/Five Hexanies.mp3)
- [Blue Hat Spy Agency](data/music/Blue Hat Spy Agency.mp3)
- [Bloom](data/music/bloom.mp3)
- [piano viola](data/music/pnovla.mp3) - Melody borrowed from Jeremy Soule.

### physical modeling

These use a string simulated via partial differentials, that models finger
positions, and collisions with frets and backboard.  The actual model is
proprietary to the [NESS project](http://www.ness.music.ed.ac.uk/), I only
interface with it:

- [guitar](data/music/ness/guitar1-96k.mp3) - Fretless guitar played with hand
and fingering simulation.
- [harmonics1](data/music/ness/harmonics1.mp3) - Melody played on
natural and artificial harmonics, ala
[đàn bầu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90%C3%A0n_b%E1%BA%A7u).
- [harmonics qin](data/music/ness/h-qin.mp3) - Open harmonics played
with yangqin technique.  Physically, this corresponds to a zither with many
open strings, which are not stopped, but only touched on harmonic nodes and
somehow still played with hammers.

### bali / carnatic

- [charukesi sketches](data/music/charukesi.mp3) Experiments mixing Balinese
and Carnatic techniques.  This doesn't follow the rules for the charukesi
ragam, so don't take the name too seriously.
- [cengceng](data/music/cengceng.mp3) Carnatic rhythm plus beleganjur.

### carnatic transcriptions

These use a notation specialized for the complex pitch curves necessary in this
kind of music.

- [Sami Ninne (sri varnam)](data/music/sami-ninne.mp3)
- [Evvari Bodhana (abhogi varnam)](data/music/evvari.mp3)

### balinese transcriptions

These use notation whose realization may vary slightly depending on
instrumental techniques and genre conventions.  The result is that doubled
parts and repeats will differ slightly, giving a more naturalistic sound.
Complicated tempo changes are expressed with nested tempos.

They use samples from my own instruments.

- [cerucuk punyah](data/music/cerucuk-punyah.mp3)
- [delima manis](data/music/delima-manis.mp3)
- [p4](data/music/p4.mp3)
- [merta1](data/music/merta1.mp3)
- [sekatian-old](data/music/sekatian-old.mp3)
- [lelambatan 3](data/music/lelambatan-3.mp3)
- [putu kreasi galungan 2003](data/music/putu-kreasi-galungan-2003.mp3)

### text score

There's a text-only score language, which is similar in concept to lilypond,
though of course with different capabilities.

This uses the built-in incremental sampler:

- [merak ngelo](data/music/merak-ngelo.mp3) -
    [score](data/score/merak-ngelo.tscore)

### old things

Old pieces, here for sentimental reasons.  Done with ST3 and ImpulseTracker.
