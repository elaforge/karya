Play also enables record on the plugin host.  The host needs to agree with
me about synth names, and have one recorder for each synth, so I can tell
it which synths to record by name.

After I hit stop, I remember the recorded time range and which instruments
were active at the time.  On playback, I suppress the playing of synths
that fall within a recorded range.  Also, when playback enters a recorded
range, it has to send a msg to the host, saying where it is.  The host will
have to be smart enough to select from the recorded clips and playback any
cached audio in that range.

To thaw a range, I remove it from the freeze map, stop suppressing the
msgs, and stop sending the host msgs for it (or tell it to delete that
range).


protocol to recorder:
- starting play
- stopping play
- start play, and record input


Of course, I'd like to work this into a full on audio recorder / sampler.  What
do I need for that?
