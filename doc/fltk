Edit either configure.in or configure to remove -fno-exceptions since I use
them, and wrapped python callbacks will use them.

--enable-debug --enable-threads --enable-quartz --enable-shared

Comment out .SILENT in makeinclude and possibly delete some of the Compiling
echos, since I like to see exactly what flags cc is getting.




the undocmunted FL_Sys_Menu_Bar can put things in the OS X main menu



FLTK STRs:

1952 - first modifier key on mac is lost
1983 - clarify event delivery documentation
1984 - provide a hook to override default event delivery



Signature changes:

    Make members virtual:

Fl_Group::insert and Fl_Group::remove should be virtual, and it should be
documented that these are always used for adding and removing widgets.  This
way you can reliably intercept those to preserve your own invariants.

remove(Fl_Widget &w) should be remove(const Fl_Widget &w)

Fl_Input_::value should be virtual.

    Member functions that overlap with their superclass's name:

These are just confusing and error prone.  And if the superclass method becomes
virtual, they won't work at all.  These are more serious changes since they
will break code:

Fl_Scroll overrides "position" to set the position of the children, but not
itself.  Fl_Tile overrides position to mean something entirely different.

Fl_Scrollbar overrides value() to take extra args.

    Other minor signature changes:

Fl_Scrollbar::value should be const (its "superclass" method is).
