    Editing recorded recorded continuous control data

Record some note data on the touchstream, or with a pitch tracker.  Select the
data, then type in a function to determine the average pitch, and pitch
derivation from equal temperment.  Type another function to warp pitches to be
closer to in tune.  Play back just the section multiple times while fiddling
with the parameters.


    Generation from other sources

Put a sample through partial extraction and generate notes from it.

Impose "bell-ness" on recorded notes by warping them to a bell spectrum: import
partials as notes, select a chord and then select the recorded sequence, and
set the recorded sequence to warp to the other selection.  For this, I need
multiple selections and the ability to operate across blocks: selection1 in
block1, selection2 in block2, and then invoke a 2 parameter function.


    dunno how to do this

Ability to handle very large chords, some more compact representation than one
per track.
