<<Move description of negative duration from Derive.Note to here.>>

General issues with arrival beats / negative duration:

- it's conceivably possible to have duration and scope separate, and invoke
special duration handling only for 0 dur events.  Otherwise it seems like it
might be awkward to use an arriving pattern in a departing score; how do
I specify the duration?  I can use the "--" event as an explicit note off.

- negative dur: this seems like a lot of pain that just boils down to deriving
from (s+1, e).  And I still don't have a solution for the redundant
'process_negative_duration' problem.  Is there another way to do
pre-derivation?

Negative dur doesn't work quite right with controls either since for
a derivation the pitch should change right when the new note is entered.



Sometimes I want to arrive on the beat, sometimes I don't.  A general way of
suppressing a note?  This is idiom, so it should be a general kind of notation.
