/* Differences from Fl_Tile:
    When dragging, only resize the widget to the left.  The widgets to the
    right get moved, except the rightmost widget, which resizes as normal
    (it's intended to be a padding widget to take up the unused space).

    The children should always be sorted left to right, top to bottom.  There
    is a protected method 'sort_children' that subclasses should call after
    inserting widgets.  Unfortunately FLTK's 'insert' is not virtual so this
    can't be done automatically.

    Some children may be marked as non-resizable ("stiff").  They are never
    resized, and their entire area can be dragged.

    The callback is called when things are dragged.

    BUGS:
    If the grab areas overlap it gets confused.  So minimum size should be
    > 2*grab_area.
