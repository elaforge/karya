This is for large data files belonging to the instrument db, like sysex dumps.

They're not in source control, because they're too big, but aren't generated
automatically, so they have to be manually synced between repos.  So they're in
a toplevel directory that is at least more obvious than being buried in
Local/Instrument/.

Ultimately, the Local/ hierarchy is supposed to be per-user configuration, so
it presumably shouldn't be in source control at all, and can go in an entirely
different directory, but I think I can put off worrying about that for now.
