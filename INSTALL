regex-pcre

    installed separately:
libpcre library from http://www.pcre.org

    fltk

configure flags:
--enable-debug --enable-threads --enable-quartz

Edit either configure.in or configure to remove -fno-exceptions since ASSERT
uses them

Comment out .SILENT in makeinclude and possibly delete some of the Compiling
echos, since I like to see exactly what flags cc is getting.

    portmidi

Edit the makefile and remove -DPM_CHECK_ERRORS

portmidi make clean should also remove */*.a
