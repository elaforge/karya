    haskell deps, from hackage
storablevector -> transformers, non-negative, QuickCheck-1
binary
dlist
hint -> ghc-paths, MonadCatchIO-mtl, ghc-mtl
haddock (only to build docs)
text
haskeline
regex-pcre
data-ordlist

    no longer in base, I think these should come from the haskell platform?
parsec
mtl
network
stm
haskell-src -> happy


    installed separately:
libpcre library from http://www.pcre.org

    fltk

configure flags:
--enable-debug --enable-threads --enable-quartz

Edit either configure.in or configure to remove -fno-exceptions since ASSERT
uses them

Comment out .SILENT in makeinclude and possibly delete some of the Compiling
echos, since I like to see exactly what flags cc is getting.

    portmidi

Edit the makefile and remove -DPM_CHECK_ERRORS

portmidi make clean should also remove */*.a
