- Install dependencies.

- Build shakefile: bin/mkmk

- Build optimized binaries: bin/mk binaries-opt

- On OS X, run 'defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false' to
re-enable key repeats globally.


    HASKELL DEPENDENCIES

To install the needed haskell dependencies, type:

cabal install --only-dependencies

The actual build is with shake, but there's a dummy cabal file with just
dependencies to make install easier.

pandoc builds the documentation, but isn't in the cabal file because it ha a
zillion dependencies and I just need the binary.  Or just read the markdown
directly, that's what it's for.  So many dependencies just to convert text to
HTML.

    INSTALLED SEPARATELY

libpcre library from http://www.pcre.org
OS X ports puts headers in /opt where configure may not find them.

libgit2 - It has no official releases, but I synced to:
https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 be5869fce0ab9c61a294020e9baa9755c58ee8a3

Make sure you sync to excatly that commit, because they break the API
frequently.

lilypond, for some fonts

    OS X:
    cp LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/share/lilypond/current/fonts/otf/emmentaler* ~/Library/Fonts

    Linux:
    cp /usr/share/lilypond/<version>/fonts/otf/ ~/.fonts
    # or
    cp /usr/share/lilypond/<version>/fonts/otf/ /usr/share/fonts/

    Use fc-list to see installed fonts and their names.

fltk-1.3, from http://fltk.org/

    LINUX

Either jack1 or jack2.  JACK support is mostly untested and probably doesn't
work.

    MISC

tools/run_profile expects ps2pdf in the path, which is part of ghostscript.
