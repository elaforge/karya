    fltk

Add -m32 to the cmdline to compile in 32 bit mode.  One possibility is to edit
makeinclude and add -m32 to OPTIM.

Edit either configure.in or configure to remove -fno-exceptions since ASSERT
uses them

Comment out .SILENT in makeinclude and possibly delete some of the Compiling
echos, since I like to see exactly what flags cc is getting.

    portmidi

Edit the makefile and remove -DPM_CHECK_ERRORS

portmidi make clean should also remove */*.a
