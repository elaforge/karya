UNSORTED
  * figure out how to display text for debugging
    . Just log to a file.
  * load sample into memory and play it
  * complain if sample rate is not the same
  * implement volume parameter
  gui
    - text output for logs
    - show play offset
    - graphical display for chunks and render progress
  - stream samples from disk and mix them
    Presumably I'll need to do this in a separate thread and put chunks in
    a ringbuffer for the processing thread.
  - msgs to disable and enable by track / instrument
  - If I want to send to VST effects separately, I'll need multiple outputs.
    The other way would be to start multiple instances, and do some muting.
