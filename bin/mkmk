# Rebuild the shakefile.

# TODO I should get the -X flags from Shakefile.ghcLanguageFlags, otherwise
# "boot" modules need explicit LANGUAGE pragmas.  I could fix it by putting
# them in a separate file, but I'm not super motivated because the boot
# modules are few and rarely modified.
# Also .fix-imports needs the list.
