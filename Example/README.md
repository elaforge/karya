Examples that are somewhat documentation.

score/cerucuk-punyah - Gender wayang, renders with MIDI, so it won't work
unless you have my samples and kontakt patch.  But it's an example of a
complicated score.

score/merak-ngelo - Gender wayang, renders with im and sampler-im, but still
requires my 800mb of samples for it.

score/squart6 - String quartet, renders with MIDI and VSL, but renders with
lilypond.  Render with `LLily.block @score`.

tscore/*.tscore - Should render with `build/opt/tscore path/to/xyz.tscore,
and mostly use im so no MIDI setup required.
