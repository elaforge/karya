multiple BlockViews on one BlockModel:

block_a = BlockModel ...
bva1 = BlockView x y w h block_a config
bva2 = BlockView x y w h block_a config

one BlockView with Tracks from multiple places:

block_b = BlockModel ...

block_ab = BlockModel
bv_ab = BlockView x y h block_ab

block_ab.add_track(track block_a)
block_ab.add_track(track block_b)


memory:

Since multiple BlockViews can share a BlockModel, and multiple TrackViews (in
different BlockViews) can share a TrackModel:

BlockModel, EventTrackModel, and RulerTrackModel all implement a reference
counting scheme.  DividerTrackModel is too trivial to be shared.  Objects that
have subobjects of this kind call a decref method on them instead of deleting
them directly.

When you delete a model, it decrefs.  If there are views on the model, their
refs should keep it alive until they are destroyed.


TODO:
- revert the refcounting changes
- install boost
- gradually convert views to use shared_ptrs to models, and models to use
weak_ptrs back to the views.
