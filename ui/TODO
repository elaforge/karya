+ ask fltk mailing list about MoveTile
+ also ask about why they use -fno-exceptions

- c interface
- haskell interface

- MoveTile implementation

- zoom implementation

ruler:
  - draw marks
  - draw mouse pos


- msg implementation: receive event, 
  entire ui should be modeless, except maybe kbd focus on inputs, so make
  sure fltk isn't doing kbd navigation or something like that


- think about how to implement snapping
- think about dragging event implementation
