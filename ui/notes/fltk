to make fltk usable:
--enable-debug --enable-threads --enable-quartz

Edit either configure.in or configure to remove -fno-exceptions since I use
them, and wrapped python callbacks will use them.

Comment out .SILENT in makeinclude and possibly delete some of the Compiling
echos, since I like to see exactly what flags cc is getting.


Fl_Group::insert and Fl_Group::remove should be virtual.

Fl_Scrollbar::value should be const.

Fl_Scroll overrides "position" to set the position of the children, but not
itself.  That seems confusing.
