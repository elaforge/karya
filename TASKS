How to do things from the command line:

-- clip a ruler:
State.get_ruler (rid "blank/meter_44") >>=
    Create.ruler "short_meter_44" . Ruler.clip 2

-- create a new ruler:
-- 8 groups of 4 groups of 4 groups of 3, each one is .75, groups of 4
-- Basically 12/8 in a binary structure.
Create.ruler "meter_98" $ MakeRuler.ruler
    [MakeRuler.meter_ruler (0.75 / (3*4))
        (MakeRuler.regular_subdivision [8, 4, 4, 3, 4])]
