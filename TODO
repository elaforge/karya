UNSORTED
  - If State.allocations is so read-only, why not make it a plain function?
    . Tests use it to write...
  * Derive.Doc type to make call args clearer
  - Fix verify_performance for save/complete/blue-hat
  - do a renaming pass on all the prev/next pitch function names in
    Derive.Args.
    . Should Prelude.Pitch.approach use the lookup pitch style?
  . Could I simplify slicing and inversion by making it into a score
    preprocessing step?  It would annotate UI Events with children, so the
    sub tracks would be in Event, not in Context.
    . If I could get rid of the ctx_sub_events / ctx_sub_tracks thing too that
      would be nice.
    . Could I also somehow make inversion universal?  The idea is to
      eliminate the thing where I forget to add Sub.inverting.
    . I could also take evaluation control away from the event, effectively it
      would mean the Sub.notes bit would be hardcoded and events would get
      [[Sub.Note]] instead of a TrackTree.  I'd lose power, but what are the
      advantages?
  . Things I don't like about evaluation:
    . All that stuff in Context.  The presence of sub_tracks can cause
      unexpected further inversion.  An example is that when I inherited
      the Context for Call.note_here, it also inherited the sub_tracks,
      which caused Call.with_pitch to be overridden.
    . It's also dumb how Context has the event (start, dur) duplicated
      in the 'event' field.  It's not duplicate info for track events
      because they have TrackTime, which is otherwise unavailable.
      This I think is ultimately due to events being in TrackTime
      context instead of (0, 1) normalized.
    . Maybe the problem is inheriting Context?  Or maybe it's awkward
      how it's effectively a manually passed packet of data, while the
      stuff in Dynamic is dynamically scoped.  Events wanting to know
      about their neighbors really does complicate things.
    simplify Context
      . Maybe I should explicitly provide specific bits of context, e.g.
        . prev, cur, and next event TrackTime
        . prev and next logical pitch
      . Say I do that, and put them in Dynamic.  How can I then get rid of
        sub_tracks?
      . I still need prev_val
      . There's nothing intrinsically wrong with Context, ultimately it's
        just an argument, like passed_vals.  I guess it's easy to remember
        passed_vals as just the arguments and understand how they work,
        while that sub_tracks stuff was confusing.
      . Maybe it's just the presence of sub_tracks in Context?  How can
        I get that out?
    . That 'collect' arg in Eval.eval_expr.  Why False for Eval.reapply
      but other functions make the caller decide?

  cache:
    - cache: In save/transcribe/bali/gabor, @b2, if I change >pemade track to
      be a parse error, '>pemade |', and then fix it, it forgets that it was
      called from the root, so presumably it gets cached as a zero and the fix
      doesn't invalidate that.
    - 'tile' messes up the cache.  If I change the tile callee's contents
      I think it rederives with only a single cycle and wrong controls.
  - Cmd.Meter: It's still useful to take r_section out of unlabeled_ranks
    so I can have gongs labeled.  How could I configure that?  Or should
    I have a specialized kind of meter for gong, like Cmd.Tala?
    . On the other side, I could imagine wanting sections for a quick chapu
      talam, where the phrase structure was e.g. 4 avartanams.
  - it looks like special kajar calls like 'oo' mess up track signal.
    . I can fix 'oo' by making DUtil.doubled_call inverting, but that doesn't
      work for 'o..'.
    . DUtil.multiple_call doesn't need inverting because it dispatches to
      call that do invert, right?
    . Actually it's pretty pernicious, because without inverting, doubled_call
      will still appear to work because the underlying call inverts.  But
      TrackSignal gets messed up, and if it did anything based on controls
      then they would not take child controls into account.
    . Why is TrackSignal messed up though?
  - do nruk with a static macro
    alias 'o..' 'nruk | o'
    . I could modify c_nruk to have a generator version that takes a deriver,
      but then I have to copy paste it.
    . How can I inherit args?  StaticMacro is no good because I want the
      generator to be late bound.  But 'nruk' should be static bound because
      it's in another module and I want to inherit its args.
    . What I really want is to inherit args and docs from the transformer, and
      apply to the generator dynamically.  So something like a static macro
      where I give all args to one transformer, and the generator is dynamic.
      I think I can do the former with a special arg, and the latter with an
      eval "static call".
    . But what happens with StaticMacro when it hits a Sig.many?  I think it's
      broken.
    . To support this, Sig.required_vals needs to support 'many' parsers.
      I could infer from ArgParser but it seems like it's getting too
      complicated.  I think at that point I had better just be able to copy
      the parser over.  Can't I just reapply to the callee?
  - charukesi: fltk/EventTrack.cc:109 sample time didn't increase: 37.2 <= 37.2
  - Use kotekan for >wy with sargam scale.
  * Special play support for tambura-like instruments, where it will start
    playing a note from the middle.
    . Instrument gets a ResumePlay flag.
    . This needs support at PlayUtil.perform_from.  events_from needs to
      scan back for the last NoteOn of the ResumePlay instruments.
    . If I want to get controls right, it would have to collect controls.
  - I should collapse adjacent Collapsed tracks so they don't turn into
    a giant blue block.
    . If I do it at the fltk draw level, then I don't have to worry about diff
      complications or tweaking indices, but I still have to model as fewer
      widgets so the index tweaking just happens lower down.
    . If I do it at the haskell level, hopefully I can reuse the existing
      Track / DisplayTrack distinction used for collapsed tracks in the first
      place.
    - I have to also collapse the skeleton, which means I need
      a Block.display_skeleton and Block.display_integrate_skeleton.
    . However, I'm not sure it's worth it.
  - The error selection is still hard to see on a busy block, I usually have
    to zoom in and do it again.
    . I think to be more visible it would have to blink or somehow be larger.
      Ideally I could have some kind of glow
      Or maybe red is just overused, if it were green or blue?
  vsl:
    - figure out how to do tuning
      . I think it needs to be pitch bend, since it doesn't seem to respond to
        MTS.  But VSL ensemble should be able to load multiple copies of the
        patch and share sample data.
      . Figure this out before doing too many more patches, because I'll have
        to update them all with global control config, unless there's a way
        to copy paste that.
      . However, it apparently can be used with hermode, so not sure how that
        happens.  Maybe I can just ask VSL support.
      . Scala files are not very good because I'd have to go manually load
        them every time, and they're static.
    . Legato attack scale control affects the crossfade level of interval
      samples, experiment with that.
      . Wait, where did this go?
    . figure out how perf reps work, and how I should handle them
    - make sure perf_upbeat_repetitions are consistent
    - make sure grace vs. grace.updown is correct
    attribute groups:
      . bass clarinet has nv without vib
    - rename +sec# to +s#?
  - Sortedness tracking for Stream and Post functions.
    . Track down usage of Stream.from_sorted_list, probably most uses are
      bogus.  Stream.from_list and Stream.from_events have to take
      Score.Events so they can sort them.
    . Sorting vensions of Post functions also have to return Score.Events to
      be able to sort them.  They could take another event_of, but it seems
      like there should be a way to compose the mapped functions instead of
      the maps.
    . I should also come up with a plan for deforesting the intermediate
      lists.
    . Order is easy to check with quickcheck.  I could come up with some ways to
      do quickchecks on certain score fragments.  Or alternately, apply
      a standard set of checks: start =0, >0, in callee block, etc.
  - Cmds don't indicate when they could abort or throw.  I rely on ad-hoc
    conventions like get_ vs. lookup_, but what about it actually being in the
    type signature?  I could try the "lightweight checked exceptions" in:
      http://www.well-typed.com/blog/2015/07/checked-exceptions/
      https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/3g41au/follow_up_safe_lightweight_checked_exceptions/
    . Or an easier way would be to put 'throw' in a subclass.
    . I have this implemented in the p-monad branch, but it didn't seem
      terribly compelling.  I think the reason is that it turns out most
      functions can throw.  It doesn't replace get_ vs. lookup_ because they
      are likely to call something else which can throw.
  - Perf.lookup_instrument on a pitch track could look at its note track.
  - I forgot to add Sub.inverting to mridangam.p1 and mridangam.pn calls.  Can
    I have a warning for when a non-inverting call has a note track below it?
  - pitch transpose
    . It's confusing how sometimes the environ is applied to the pitch during
      derivation (e.g. Post.set_instrument), and sometimes it waits for Convert
      to do it.  Do I really need both?
    . Post.set_instrument needs to set because I need the environ from the new
      inst.  Could I instead overlay the environ into the event environ?
    . It's error prone because there's nothing that enforces that you set
      instrument with Post.set_instrument, and if you don't, it will work until
      you use a scale with e.g. tuning, and then it will be slightly off.
    . Originally added in the patch 'add interpolate scale':
      The bigger problem was that since pitches got the Environ at conversion
      time, the interpolate scale couldn't substitute `key-from` and `key-to`
      because any environ values it set before evaluating the pitch wouldn't
      "stick".

      So I switched to applying the environ when the pitch is created, but this
      broke the case that made me switch to applying environ at the end in the
      first place, which is when switching instruments in a postproc I want the
      new instrument's environ, specifically Environ.tuning, to apply to the new
      event's pitches.  So now when I switch instruments I have to explicitly
      apply the environ from the new instrument, via Post.set_instrument.
    . Also error prone: I applied octave transpositions via Call.add_constant,
      but then realize-ngoret uses transposed nn to infer, and untransposed
      pitch for the final pitch, so I get a confusingly wrong result.  The
      solution is to apply via Pitches.transpose, but I shouldn't have to make
      complicated decisions like that.

  - empty track doesn't get an Environ, which causes Cmd.Track to not be able
    to find the instrument.
    . It was because the kendang tracks were below >pno, not "tempo".  So, two
      problems:
      . It's too hard to see that the skeleton is wrong.
      . Note track children should have dynamics too.
  - Do I need Perform.perform_control_msgs.trim or not?  Figure it out and
    write a test if I do need it.
  - fix control scope in parent events that cover up an orphan, as
    demonstrated in Sub_test.test_overlapping_parent_control_scope
  - Better solution for the "sample at end of block" problem, as demonstrated
    by Block_test.test_trim_controls_problem
  wayang
    - Automatically fill in weak notes?
      . This also applies to reyongan, even more so.
      . In fact this is similar to noltol.
    - many double strikes or ngoret tones land a bit ahead of the beat
    - I want some optional ngoret to happen the same way in both hands.
      I could make it apply to a parallel kempyung or octave.
      . I'd need a fancier ngoret that understands 'inst-top' so it can go
        down if necessary.
  - thru on *legong notes is wrong the first time
    can see this editing rehearsal/kendang-legong
  / can I make Edit.cmd_set_duration use alter_duration?  Also, why do I need
    modify_event_near_point, doesn't ModifyEvent.selection already do that?
  - Play position doesn't work right for 'loop' and 'tile' calls, it only
    understands the first loop, and doesn't know that 'tile' cuts off the
    beginning.

  - %sus-abs=-.x is not quite right for detached, because it should scale
    a bit for shorter notes.  E.g. it's absolute but scales down to 0 below
    a certain threshold.

  - network midi doesn't seem to handle abort?
    playing the second time doesn't happen
  - I have a feeling like FM8 doesn't obey ResetAllControls
    Maybe I should extend Midi.Interface.note_tracker to keep track of
    used CCs to issue resets for them.  Some reset to 1, e.g. cc2 and cc7,
    the rest reset to 0.

documentation:
  - Publish haddock with http://documentup.com/feuerbach/standalone-haddock
  - Can I have Util.Linkify check the validity of single-quote links?  Or
    maybe I could run a link checker against the final output.  Otherwise
    'Module.function' references get out of date.
  calldoc: CallDoc:
    - collapse control for modules, option to collapse / expand all
      . Haddock:
        <span id=xyz class="module collapser"
          onclick="toggleSection('n.1')">Title</span>
        <ul id='section.n.1' class='show'> ...
    / put anchors on calls and make single quotes link to calls
      . It's not quite so simple because there is module, and then namespace.
        So the linkifier would have to understand that structure and search
        for one, or have some javascript, and then it would have to choose
        if there is >1 match.  Too complicated.
    / For call doc, can I group calls with the same doc but different args,
      especially different defaults?
      . Would look like:
        doc doc doc generator
        bind -- name
          args
    - I could go look through arg docs for controls and list all the controls
      that have someone listening to them in a certain scope.

Synth: Im:
  csound backend:
    . Use csound-expression?
  - The start time should be in fractions of a second instead of sample
    frames, so I'm not dependent on sample rate.  Also, will I need to emit
    negative time?
  - If there is only one cache mutated by the synth, then a play in process
    will be spoiled by a new render.  I can fix this by making a new cache
    each time, and hardlinking the unchanged entries.  I can remove the old
    one if the play is stopped and there is a newer one, so this could be done
    by the PlayCache vst.
  more efficient Perform.Im.Convert
    - Zero-copy conversion for the signals.
      . But first I have to decide how I want to handle interpolation.
      . This doesn't matter as long as the synth doesn't support signals.
    - Trim signals.

shakefile: build:
  - use new system calls and logging levels
  automatic "All.hs" modules
    . I'm reluctant because it's simpler to have normal files, and it's not
      that hard to update them.
    - Derive.Call.All looks for (note|pitch|control)_calls from Derive/Call/,
      but could also take from Local/Call/*
    - Local.Instrument looks for 'load' from Local/Instrument/
  - once upon a time, the shakefile took .2s to discover the build is up to
    date.  Now it's up to .7s.  Where is the time going?

incremental save / git:
  + try saving individual events for incremental save
    Seems to be just as slow as full save, probably most of the time is in
    the call to git.  Test again with larger tracks.
  - wrap operations in a lock file
  - make sure things are ok if it fails at any step
  - I don't think Ui.State needs to emit CmdTrackAllEvents for cases where
    diff will catch it.
  - See if git's delta compression understands binary and can compress
    tracks.  Otherwise, would it be worth helping it by e.g. separating
    each event with a newline?  But then it makes serializing events more of
    a hassle.

integrate / integration:
  score integrate
    - cascading score integrates
      Is there really a use for this, other than consistency?
  derive integrate
    - attrs that the instrument understands can turn into +attr calls, if
      they're not in the CallMap, e.g. save/test/wayang
    - adding a +soft stroke means it gets both less dyn and +soft again, so
      it's extra soft
    - bug: can't delete a derived track, it just gets regenerated
    - bug: can't undo past a integrate create, it just creates a new one
      Maybe I could not record the integrate step?
    - bug: create tracks, remove <, re-add <, does it work?
      Removing < should break the integrate links.
    - Ensure cascading track integration works.
    - If integrate is committing changes to a track, can that bite me if
      a "canceled" derivation comes through?  Think about this later.
    - quantization

lilypond:
  - lilypond: espressivo <> should be like a normal hairpin
    But the way to do this is awkward, << .. { s4 s4 \< s4 \> s4 \! } >>
    . I also want tied notes to expand to 'c4~ \< c4 \>'
      But that has problems, I need a \!.
    . Even '<< b'2.~ { s4 \< s4 \> s4 } >> | b'4 cs''4 \!'
      is not ideal, the decrescendo extends to underneath the next note.
      If I put \! on the tied-to note, it still won't extend.
    . see \at in https://github.com/openlilylib/openlilylib/tree/master/input-shorthands/articulations-not-aligned-with-notes
    . Ideally:
      a \cresc \decresc % over duration of the note
      a \cresc ~ a \decresc % same
  - Lilypond.write_empty_staff creates incorrect rests for a tuple, as shown
    in Lilypond_test.test_add_bass_staff
  - to make notes without duration, ignore the existing duration and choose
    the simplest possible duration.  For zheng, yangqin, percussion.
    . Exception for +trem
  - warning if ly-prepend or ly-append is being omitted due to a chord
  - Maybe code events with a voice should go in the voice requested rather
    than mixed into the first one.  E.g. would have fixed grace notes.
  - one track has voice, the other doesn't, causes a "can't advance time
    backward" error
  - Support ly-append-first and ly-append-last for zero-dur notes.
    . First come up with uses for them?  Or do it just for orthogonality?
  - code events in >ly-global can be distributed to all staves
    Otherwise I have to remember to add e.g. ly-key to all staves manually.
    . But ly-key is no good, I really do need to set the key.  I think I have
      to break up the block.  Why can't I do assignment more easily?
    . Well, I have to grab a deriver to dynamically scope the new value around.
      Unless I let a deriver mutate the environ, then it has to be nested.  If
      a deriver can mutate, then events have to be evaluated in order.  Of
      course, they already do for controls because of the previous sample.
      And since it's unset at the end of the block, block caching still works,
      the same way as for previous sample.
    . On the other hand, I think I want to encourage nestedness and it should
      be easy to split.  The only reason viola-sonata has huge blocks is that
      it's a midi import.
  - If I can figure out the meter from just the name, then I can get rid
    of the awkward map with hardcoded meters.
    I could have parse generate the Meter and memoize it.
  - optionally emit the lilypond to display a compound meter, e.g. 3+2/8
  jianpu
    . Research jianpu conventions, but basically:
      . Hide staff lines, stems, beams.
      . Noteheads replaced by numbers
      . Use a somewhat proportional layout.
      . Lines for 8th, 16th etc. notes.
      . Dots for octaves.
      . Stack chords vertically.
      . Grace notes as superscripts.
      . I still use lilypond's bars, slurs, tuplets, dynamics, etc.
    . http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/mwrhome/jianpu-ly.html

        principles.

negative duration / arrival beats:
  new arrival notes scheme infer-duration:
    . I don't want to trim because I might need the controls if I extend the
      duration.  I do want to trim because I don't want e.g. t-dia at start
      from the caller, but I do want pitch at start from the block.
    . t-dia:  0   1   0
              b1  b2
              a b|c   d
              a b|    d
    . If 'c' is present, then I clip off t-dia because I drop controls
      starting at 1.  The starts are replaced with ones from b1.
      So the sample at 'start' should come from the local block only.
      Samples after start can be used from global.  So what if the block
      call just deleted samples at exactly block end?  Any local tracks
      could put a sample there, but otherwise the event gets control signal
      afterwards.  If there is a note to replace, the >start samples are
      replaced, but otherwise, I get the ones from the caller.
    . E.g. global filter sweep.  A infer-duration note would stick out
      because the sweep is meant to be continuous.  In this case, I can
      just use the untrimmed control.  But t-dia should not do that, unless
      I really am treating it continuously.  This is the same problem as
      whether a control should continue changing into the decay or not.  The
      sweep should, but a pitch belongs to the next note.  So maybe this is
      a fundamental limitation of the score language.
  represent arrival notes differently
    . Instead of representing arrival notes as the sounding time plus
      a negative duration, I could represent them as a start time plus a flag.
      If the flag is set, it's considered an arrival note and the trigger line
      is drawn at the bottom instead of the top.
    pros:
      1 Cmds work the same for negative and positive durations, I don't have
        to do any special checks for overlapping with a following negative
        event.
      2 I can have a note arrive and another depart from the same point, e.g.
        trill up to a note.
    cons:
      3 The encoding seems not as elegant.  I can still do it with negative
        durations, but now the negative is just a flag, rather than
        representing the actual extent of the duration.
    4 This means that cmds work spatially rather than logically,
      i.e. I'll need a separate "set beginning" cmd since it becomes set
      duration for negative events.  I don't know if that's a pro or con, but
      it feels like a con since I need more cmds.
    #1 might not be compelling if I've already done the work to get them to
    work, but if it's buggy or turns into continual for for every cmd then it
    becomes a big deal.

local: plugins:
  I also want local code in haskell.
    . I could put code in Local.Score.SomeName, and have those either
      statically linked in, or dynamically compiled and loaded on each
      derivation.
    . Static linking is easier, but I should at least automatically create
      a All.hs.
    . Also, creating calls is a bit heavyweight, since I likely don't care
      about tags and doc and module can be inferred.  Presumably I can get
      around that with a constructor that defaults those fields, and then
      the generated All.hs overrides the module.
    . Writing in tracklang lacks typechecking.  There could be utilities to
      write like tracklang, but in haskell, e.g.
        c_p1 = with_note_call "p" "subst1" $ block "pattern"
  . ghc can now unload code: http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/8039
  . might be relevant: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/dynamic-loader
    http://codeutopia.net/blog/2011/08/20/adventures-in-haskell-dynamic-loading-and-compiling-of-modules/
  . to do per-score code, I can put it in Local.Score.<namespace>
    Convert to module name by replacing -x with (upper x) and capitalizing the
    first letter.
    Then when you load a score, incorporate the static config from that
    module.  Shakefile can link in the local modules under the right name.
    . If it gets to be too much overhead to link on every single build, then
      I can load dynamically at runtime.

cleanup:
  - It seems I get slicing on an already sliced track if I have an
    intermediate empty note track, e.g.:
      [(">", [(0, 1, "")]), ("> | +a", []), ("*", [(0, 0, "4c")])]
    . Is it a problem?  Should I skip if already sliced?  Document if it's ok.
  - use Data.Vector.Algorithms.Search.binarySearch instead of my own, but
    make sure it has the right specializations.
    . Or at least use mine in Util.Vector.
  - BaseTypes.CallId should have a name more reminiscent of Symbol.
    CallSymbol?
  - Modification of State is still kind of messy since I have lens and
    non-lens versions.  And if I wanted to modify with a lens I wouldn't be
    able to add an effect, like causing damage.  If I used ekmett lenses maybe
    I could unify effectful modification.  I'd also need a way to focus
    on UI state.
    . For example, I can add an allocation with State.allocations, but if
      I wanted to make that cause damage I couldn't.  Of course maybe it
      doesn't matter since I infer damage based on config changes.
    . Also I can't make sure that StateConfig.allocate is used instead of
      directly modifying the map.  The root of the problem is that I have
      unrestricted modification via State.modify_config, but even if I removed
      that I'd want something as convenient as lenses, but with the posibility
      of effects, or at least access to Ui.State and Cmd.State.
    . That said, I'm not sure how much this actually matters.  Maybe I should
      wait to see if it's actually a problem before worrying about it.
    . I guess it already has been a bit of a problem, in that the test had
      a bug where it put on the wrong backend.
  - Why re-export StateConfig from Ui.State?  Why not directly reference
    StateConfig?
  - Can I make prev val or {Note,Control,Pitch}Deriver return values more
    typesafe with GADTs?
    . Study https://github.com/goldfirere/glambda for ideas.
  See about removing type prefix from record fields.
    . However, if there are lenses, then I need those names for the lenses.
      But perhaps the plain version can have a leading _?
    . Another bonus of the leading _ is I don't have to worry about unused
      function warnings.
    - Cmd.State
    - Derive.Deriver.Monad
    - Ui.State
    - Ui.StateConfig
    - Perform.Midi.Instrument
  - Util.TimeVector has a hack where a sample at <=0 is considered to extend
    to -inf.  It's because I want a control track call at 0 to extend back.
    But I could do that directly with a postproc ala the tempo hack.  It seems
    like a hack at a higher level is better than one deep in the signal
    implementation.
  - Expr is NonEmpty since there is always at least a "" call, but this is a
    special feature of events.  Would it make more sense to parse "" as [],
    and then special case [] in EvalTrack.derive_event?
    . But I'd need a newtype, otherwise ShowVal [Call] overlaps.  Of course
      the only reason it doesn't already overlap is that a don't have
      a ShowVal for NonEmpty.
    . But Quoted is also Expr... should it be non-empty?
    . I now don't remember where it was that I had an Expr that made sense as
      [], so maybe I don't care about this anymore?
  - Move Derive.info_prev_val to the environ, maintained by EvalTrack.
    . This gets rid of all the Taggable stuff, at the cost of making
      Args.prev_val in Deriver and dynamically typed.
    . There's no Val for Score.Event, so I can't use it for note tracks.
      Of course I could just add one, maybe not a big deal.
  - Overlap detection in Derive.Slice I think is still messed up, or at the
    least it's more complicated than it should be.
  - I could make the fltk interface clearer by putting c_interface.cc into
    fltk, and then putting all the types it depends on in one header.
    . I could make that a .c file too, and get rid of the sketchy hsc2hs on
      c++, as well as clang's "treating 'c' input as 'c++' when in C++ mode"
  - Update.BlockSkeleton sets Block.Status, and so does Update.BlockTrack.  If
    I merge status update into skeleton updates I can take Status out of
    Block.DisplayTrack.
  - split up CallInfo depending on type
    I got started but was discouraged when it came time to write
    GetLastSample, maybe I should make another go.
    Note tracks can't get a GetLastSample at all.
  / storing TrackEvents without duration would make maintaining the
    no-overlap invariant easier.  E.g. have explicit 'off' events, otherwise
    each event extends to the next one.  It means after merging I have to
    clear redundant offs, but that's easier right?
    . Insert, positive: clear Ends from Event.start until the next key,
      then insert [(Event.start, event), (Event.end, End)]
    . Insert, negative: clear Ends from prev key until Event.start, then
      insert [(Event.trigger, End), (Event.start event)].
    . On read: when I take out the Event, set the duration based on prev End
      or next End.
    . Pros: impossible to have overlaps.
    . Cons: still have to clear out those Ends, which might be around the same
      amount of work as clipping.  Also, just reading events allocates.

performance:
  - input lag, debug with Trace.traceEventIO
    . http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2012/10/future-work-warp
    . Reyong input in save/transcribe/bali/gabor is laggy.  In fact even
      disabling a track with 'D' is laggy.
    . But not always.  Maybe only after editing for a while?
    . Can I use custom events to see lags in threadscope?
      . Yes, but hard to visualize with everything there.
        I can get labels with View -> Event labels, but often they are jammed
        together, and draw inconsistently.
      . What do the numbers in threadscope's green bars mean?  ThreadId?
      . What I want is for each respond cycle to see where pauses were, and
        why.  I'd want to bracket the respond cycle outside of waiting for the
        next msg, get the total duration of each one.  Possibly I can do that
        by using ghc-events to process the eventlog.
    - GHC's +RTS -v flag is documented but doesn't exist.
      It only exists when -debug, but this isn't documented.
    . Moving the selection gets really laggy on save/transcribe/bali/gabor
  - Criterion testing: why is cmd_derive faster than derive?  It should be
    doing more work!
  - experiment with GC flags, e.g. -H.
    . Try compiling with a larger generation 0: +RTS -A128m -RTS
    . Profile seq with larger gen 0 and separate arenas for different cores:
      +RTS -A128m -n2m -RTS
    . What about -I0 to turn of idle GC?  Or maybe -I1?  I want to avoid it
      running in the tiny gaps between entering notes, but do want it to run
      if I make a longer pause.
  - find space leaks with nmitchell's stack limit technique:
    . run build/profile/verify_performance +RTS -K975K -xc -RTS --mode=Profile
        p/cerucuk-punyah.state
      Derive.LEvent.events_of,
      called from Derive.Stream.zip3_on.\,
      called from Derive.Stream.emap,
      called from Derive.Stream.zip3_on,
    . Also, what's with the compile_library stuff in the middle?  Should
      I make it stricter?
    . Giving up for the moment since I don't understand the output.
  . Seq.sort_on winds up calling compare on Stack 13374153 times! 9.1% time
    I have to sort it because the stack is kept in reverse order.
    - Per-track stuff can wind up happening zillions of times due to
      inversion, so look for other places where I do work or collect data
      on every track fragment.
    - At least at one point, keeping EnvKey.seed up to date was expensive, and
      it's not even needed when there's no randomization.
    - I could analyze TrackWarp or TrackDynamic to get stats on how many times
      each block is called, along with overall stats on how many notes.  Just
      an interesting thing to know.
  understand deriver performance
    . I never know if changes I am making help or hurt performance, because I
      don't trust any of my profiles.  This means I hardly ever run them, at
      which point why bother having them?

    . Productivity is actually really good during derivation: 70-80%.  Only if
      I turn on heap profiling does it go down to 33%.  So maybe there's
      nothing to do?  Still, it seems like it's slower than it should be.

    . I want to find out how much list copying happens due to Stream being
      a list.  Perhaps I can use SCC annotations?  For transforms, I want to
      see the effect of a transform copying the whole stream so I can tell if
      making it interleave has an effect.
      . It would be nice to see how many times each cons is copied, but it
        would have to be for the output stream specifically.  How can I do
        that?  I think I would have to make my own list type, then count
        allocated cells?
    . Also, from heap profiling, the vast majority is PINNED, which is
      presumably ByteString.  But what is it then, if I'm using Text for
      events now?

  research using pipes for generators and transformers
    . This would handle the composed transforms thing.
    . What about parallelization?
    . What about the MergeList idea?
    . The bigger question is how do I do dynamic state when all the different
      calls are interleaved?
    . Actually now I'm thinking pipes aren't suitable for this.  Pipes are
      about interleaving effects, but derivation is pure.  But not quite,
      since it does depend on StateT.  In a pipes implementation, a generator
      would be 'P.Producer Event Deriver ()', and a transformer would take
      a Producer to another Producer.  Actually, since calls need to typecheck
      etc., it winds up being:
        type Events = Producer Event Deriver ()
        type Generator = Deriver Events
        type Transformer = Deriver (Events -> Events)
      . In a pure environment, pipes still give a constant bound on how many
        elements I hold on to at a time.  But since I look ahead arbitrarily
        much, maybe I don't want that.
    - Set up a pipeline over a StateT that returns Event.
    . The way to do this without pipes would be for transformer to be
      Deriver (Stream -> Stream).  Then I can run all the transformers, and
      then compose all their functions.  At that point, the only thing pipes
      would really give me is a clear picture of how many elements I need
      because each one needs to be specifically awaited... but it seems like
      the look-ahead stuff would be really inconvenient.  And I do the same
      thing, it's just less convenient with pipes.
      . It does mean I have to express all transformers purely.  This is true
        for the non-monadic Post functions, but it means I can't express ones
        where a previous monadic effect on a previous element effects a later
        one.  But that only applies to Threaded, and I can get that anyway by
        threading myself, so maybe there's no problem?
      . The way to prove that would be to remove the monadic Post.emap
        functions.
  make composed transforms more efficient
    . Composed transforms have to keep the whole event stream in memory since
      they can't interleave.
    . Would it then be possible to deforest the intermediate lists?  Bulit-in
      deforestation won't work because of the intervening call machinery, but
      maybe I can recreate it manually.
    - First, figure out how to measure the amount of memory used by
      intermediate lists.  It might be completely trivial.
    - First, I have to detach threaded state for the actual map.  This is
      possible because I don't care about Threaded or Collect.  So modify
      Post.emap_m to map a Derive.run over every element.  Then I need to
      collect the output and turn Left into a Log... or leave it in the stream
      somehow so I can throw at the end.
    - I think the stream will then remain lazy, and I should be able to GC
      as it goes, but verify with Debug.trace.
  - I'd like to see if directly modifying Collect or a MergeList for LEvents
    could reduce garbage, so I need to get some profiling up first.
    . monad-par-extras Control.Monad.Par.AList is deprecated due to poor
      performance, what's up with that?
  - Internal.merge_collect is constantly merging in mempty, try reducing its
    use.  Can I continue to enforce monoid-nature?
  - I should be able to move samples only when converting to MIDI, this way
    I don't need to move parts of the signal that wind up being trimmed.
    Either try to trim the signal earlier again, or delay transformation to
    Perform.
  - https://github.com/tobami/codespeed can make a web page with perf graphs
  . Signal.sig_op has 4.8% alloc, from Control.cotrol_call ->
    Derive.with_relative_control -> Perform.sig_multiply
    . So default multiplication for dyn is expensive.
  / The Control.put_signal_fragment work is done on a second call to
    a track, even though the output is never used.  Can I fix that?
    . I would need to notice in the collect that there's already an entry in
      Derive.collect_track_signals.  But for that I can't pass an empty
      collect.  I still think it belongs in collect though, because it's
      not an actual data dependency, it just makes it more efficient if it
      is.
    . This is possible now that I thread Collect... well, except it's not
      because Cache clears it.  But in any case, I don't think I can get
      a second call to a track if I am only collecting signals for the
      toplevel block.
  scrolling through giant blocks is slow
    - drawing is stil slow, I'll have to look at the fltk layer
      It happens when the block is wide.  Use test_block to see if it's just
      fltk.
      . It's fltk.  Not alpha draw though.
      Scrolling is weirdly chunky near the top when fl_scroll() is on.
      Curiously it doesn't seem to help at all.
    - Would it be faster to call fl_scroll once for all the tracks?  I could
      also theoretically call find_events all at once too, though that
      shows up low on the profile, so maybe it's not a big deal.
    . The thing is, it seems like fl_scroll doesn't actually help scrolling
      speed at all.  Maybe all the time is spent elsewhere?
  - Store signal chunks in the Ui.Track so they can be directly emitted.
    This is only useful for large chunks of 'set' calls, probably recorded
    from MIDI.  So it's probably not pressing until that feature exists.
    . make Ui.Events into 'Map ScoreTime (Event | Chunk Signal)'
    . collapse chunks of adjacent 'set' calls into a Chunk
    . track_derive on a Chunk just returns the contents
    . fltk event render should detect too dense events and omit them, rely
      on the signal render
    . UI edits should see the Chunk expanded out as Events.  Inserting an
      event should modify the chunk or split it depending on if the inserted
      event is a set call or not.
  Cmd
    - If a msg aborts or doesn't run any cmds, don't bother to run diff.
      Except that hardly ever happens if I do shortcut thru.
    - cache track cmds for each track, update when the track title or skeleton
      changes
  Derive
    - parallelize derivation
    AppendList / MergeList for Derive.Stream
      - switch to AppendList and try to get garbage down
        Avoid copying sublists returned by block calls and cache hits
      - play from cursor is a linear scan on all events from the beginning,
        seems like this would be faster if I could skip chunks.
      - see if a Merge constructor can reduce copying
      - can I cache length and range in AppendList?  does it matter?
      - insert parallelism?  maybe the evaluator can do that when it sees
        Merge?
    - lazy signals
      - check out 'at' and 'bsearch' occurrances and see if they can use tails
      - There are lots of lookups in the tempo map
    - see if making a version of Derive.local that's non-monadic in the
      modifier has any effect on performance
    derive cache
      - can I cache long blocks by slicing them if they're >n?
      - c_block should only cache if the block has > a certain number of
        events.
      - I won't rederive cached generators if they have control damage outside
        of the event range.  But there's nothing stopping a generator from
        reading ahead or behind... come up with some kind of solution for this.
    - fair amount of garbage generated by SignalBase.bsearch_above, I think
      this is because it has to box the values when it pulls them out.  But
      it's really just comparing to a Double, so I should be able to do the
      operation unboxed.  But decide about lazy signals before going nuts on
      this.  If I revert to linear search then none of this is necessary.
    - at_linear is called a lot by compose, by compose_warp, by d_warp
      can I make this more efficient?

fltk:
  - linux fltk drawing: event ears draw as a solid bar
  - Track titles are still cramped, and even with the expand thing it's still
    awkward to edit text in them, and annoying to not be able to see what's in
    them.  Much of the problem is that for editing I want the tracks to be
    narrow as possible, but that's too small for editing the title.
    . How about making the title expand horizontally in addition to
      vertically?
  - Manually fiddling with track widths is annoying.  It seems like I could
    ask the UI about text extents to resize them automatically.
  - I never wound up using rank > 1, so presumably I could simplify things by
    calling it 'bool align_right' or something.
  - When multiple marks from different marklists are in the same place, their
    text collides.  The one from the first marklist should take precedence,
    as should its line.  This is visible when I add logical range markers.
  - If I wrap text, and there is then space available on the right, check if
    I can squeeze in ranked text.
  ? There's an extra axis of information in the width of the event body.  How
    could I use that?
  - Text in negative events doesn't wrap.
  - It would be nicer if WrappedText could take an always_wrap=true flag to
    make it wrap even when there's no space, for edit input.  However, this
    would complicate the wrapping algorithm and would mean I have to store
    breaks explicitly, instead of just replacing '\n' with ' '.
  - add edit and windows menu to all apps
    There must be special OS X support for these
    Apparently not?  iTerms is defined in English.lproj/MainMenu.xib

    But it doesn't say how to add the Window menu.
  drawing artifacts on retina:
    . Some of this may be fltk bugs.
    - tops of tracks and the tops of track text boxes still get gunk, visible
      when scrolling horizontally
  - Should fltk collapse adjacent dividers?
  - bug: There's a focus bug, but I'm not sure how to reproduce it.
    . The focus bug is still here.  Even clicking on the "unfocused" block
      doesn't fix it.  Don't all msgs contain focus?  What can I log after the
      fact to figure out what's going on?
    . Actually this makes me think it's actually in MsgCollector.
      In that case it would be Fl::focus() which is wrong.  Is there a way to
      just ask the OS what window has focus?
    . Cmd.state_debug_ui_msgs doesn't help because I have to take off focus to
      turn it on.  I would need a key stroke that does that.
  - I could set certain Symbols to stretch to the length of their event, this
    would yield a nicer looking score.  But it would mess up the bounds
    detection.

    I can set something like kUtilityWindowClass in Fl_mac.cxx:Fl_X::make, but
    it doesn't get any kbd input
    . can I get fltk to omit the jellybean buttons on the window?
      . Yes, but requires hacking fltk.
      . Completely disables resizing.  Apparently this is hardcoded.
  incremental redraw / scrolling
    . I don't like the current situation of incremental redraw and scrolling.
      It's also buggy, i.e. one pixel difference between scroll and redraw.
      Get rid of damage and redraw everything every time.  Then I have to make
      it fast to fetch the data for one screenful.  What makes that slow
      currently?
    . Entirely turned it off, speed seems acceptable.

    . Did the objc call, but doesn't seem to have any effect.

  control track, render signal
    - render option: solid with color gradient
    - combine multiple signals, e.g. one controls xpos, one controls color
      I could combine pitch and dyn.  This is appropriate for the note track.
      . I'm pretty sure OS X can do this, as can cairo, so I would need to
        figure out how to get direct access to that API.  I could get rid of
        the awful alpha_draw.cc hack while I'm at it.
      . Or perhaps I should just switch to OpenGL?

    . But I also got:
      . logview: ./log/seq.log: openFile: resource busy (file is locked)
      . Apparently not caused by log rotation.  Maybe if it checks for
        rotation at the same time a new line is written?

  - Some way to associate a custom pretty-printer with test input or output,
    e.g.:
      annotate :: (Eq a, Show a) => (a -> Text) -> (a -> a) -> a -> a -> IO Bool
      annotate format f input expected
          | output == expected = equal input output
          | otherwise = do
              equal input output
              putStrLn "input:" >> putStrLn (format input)
              putStrLn "ouput:" >> putStrLn (format output)
              putStrLn "expected:" >> putStrLn (format expected)
              return False
          where output = f input
      ...
      let equal = annotate draw Module.function
    . It feels bogus to duplicate the (==) comparison.  Maybe have an
      parameterized version of 'equal'?
    . Use this with Events.draw_events, it should be useful for all event
      triplets.

  - delete build/test/tmp on every test run to avoid test contamination
    . test/run_tests will clear it out, but sometimes I run them directly
    . But this is pretty much limited to expecting a file in a certain
      place, which pretty much only Perform.Im.Convert does.  Tests that
      create tmp files should use Testing.unique_tmp_dir.
  - Integrate_test.test_block_integrate is flaky, sometimes I get:
    __-> Cmd/Integrate_test.hs:48 [test_block_integrate]
    ((bid "test/b2"),
     [(">s/i1", [(0.0, 1.0, ""), (1.0, 1.0, "")]),
      ("*", [(0.0, 0.0, "4d"), (1.0, 0.0, "4c")])])
      /=
    ((bid "test/b2"),
     [(">s/i1", [(0.0, 1.0, ""), (1.0, 1.0, ""), (2.0, 1.0, "")]),
      ("*", [(0.0, 0.0, "4e"), (1.0, 0.0, "4d"), (2.0, 0.0, "4c")])])
  criterion
    / it seems unreasonably fast, why is it so much faster than in seq?
      . 5us for 128 events, plus no_invert is slower than invert?
      . And shouldn't perform for invert and no_invert be the same?
      . Maybe I should force the track signals too?
      . 'seq' was being slowed down by startup overhead.
    - score from a file
    - parsing
  complete quickcheck derive testing
    I switched back to Double for RealTime, but this means the roundoff errors
    are back.  Use quickcheck to repro them.
    + make a simple deriver that creates event and midi output skeletons
    - integrate quickcheck with generate_run_tests.py
    - assert that the reduced deriver output equals the simple deriver output
    - basic pitches: If the score was created with notes aligned to note
      starts, then every NoteOn should have the appropriate key, there should
      be no pitch bends, and "same note" should be the only reason for
      a channel split
    - basic controls: Given randomly placed control events, notes have the
      correct control curves.  Don't worry about times or midi.
    - slicing: Given some simple note transformers (tuple, place, ...),
      pitches and controls are still associated with the right notes as above.
      Don't worry about times, just that the right notes and the right
      controls.
    - block call property: a couple levels of nesting for block calls, notes
      still have the expected pitches and controls as above
    - inversion: as 'basic pitches' and 'basic controls', but controls are
      below the note tracks, results should be the same
    - stack: generate nested events, check that stack is as expected
  - count number of tests in addition to checks within each test

midi record:
  - implement
  . Ideas for editing recorded MIDI:
    . control: realign attacks, smooth or sharpen attacks.
    . pitch: retune intervals, fix wrong note or add notes, change portamento
      speed.  Add, widen, or narrow vibrato.

REPL: repl:
  - repl now has no history when it doesn't know the filename.
    Maybe I should have it ask for the filename.  I'll need a protocol anyway
    to ask for tab-completion.
      data Query = QUpdate | QCommand Text
      data Response = RUpdate FilePath [Text] | RCommend Result [Log]
      type Log = Text
      data Result = Raw !Text | Format !Text
  - only write history when the cmd succeeded
  - command to open the haddock for a module
  - is Cmd.Lang.Fast now obsolete?
  - can I get local variable bindings (let x = ...; y <- ...) to work in the
    REPL?
  - tab completion for symbols like in ghci
    I'll need a list symbols cmd which the repl automatically sends on tab
    completion.
  - :compile cmd that turns on compilation for everything except Environ
  - :browse to look in modules... can I use GHC.getBindings for this?
  - :module cmd to move evaluation context to a certain module, maybe I
    could also get rid of the need for Cmd.Lang.Environ to import everything.

Cmd:
  Repl:
    - LNote.sort_on_pitch is still not right.
      . With multiple chords I get stacked up extra tracks.
      . Turns out this seems really complicated.  Do I really care that much?
  - Paste between blocks with different track layout is awkward.  Can I have
    a note-oriented paste that reuses or creates the track structure?
  - ModifyNotes doesn't seem to understand about parent note tracks.
  - Interpret a midi file with keyswitches back to the attrs.
    . This is so I can load VSL examples and learn from them.
    . Should it be a score transformation, or start from the parsed MIDI?
    . MIDI seems easier because it's already in a linear format, while for
      the score I'd have to interpret it into one.
    . But then I need to pass the instrument mapping to Midi.load.
    . Maybe not really worth it?  For learning I can load in reaper and just
      watch the VSL UI.
    . But still worth keeping existing work, because I'll need something like
      that for MIDI record.
  - Figure out exactly what bad things could happen because of the
    Ui.fltk_event_loop race.  Also figure out what kind of cancelling I'd need
    to fix them.
  + Write a fancy tile like ViewConfig.horizontal_tile but guesses if you mean
    to tile vertically.
  - Create tempo by "stretching", i.e. select start and end, and create tempo
    mark that will cause the start point to be played where the end point used
    to be played.
  - give Cmd.ModifyEvents.Track the ability to change the track title?
    Cmd.Repl.LPitch.change_scale and to_relative could use this.
  meter / timestep
    - timestep 64*2 skips two 's', because 's' is the minimum match
      skip should be ignored when the match is a larger rank than exists, or
      maybe step should fail.
  / Can I give Cmds their own state without putting it in Cmd.State every time?
    At worst I can have 'Map.Map String Dynamic'.

    Use existentials:
      data forall a. Cmd = Cmd {
        cmd_func :: a -> CmdT (Status, Cmd)
        , cmd_state = a
      }
    This means that such cmds have to be able to be updated after they are run,
    so the cmd lists have to be kept in responder state.  If I'm going to do
    that, why not have cmds optionally return a continuation and handle state
    that way?

      cmd msg = do
        state <- stuff
        return $ continue $ \msg -> do
          more stuff

    Or if I can put it in the monad:
      cmd msg = do
        state <- stuff
        msg2 <- yield Cmd.Done
        more stuff

    For module level, each module of cmds would have to export a bunch of Cmds
    and the responder retrieves the state and passes in another layer of
    StateT, or directly.  I supposed Dynamic wouldn't be so bad for that.  What
    happens when the module is reloaded?

  ruler:
    - meter type and the construction functions should be integrated more
      tightly
    - LRuler.inject, opposite of extract, replaces sub-block rulers
  Cmd.Edit
    - Make Edit.cmd_invert_orientation set orientation based on the first
      selected event, so I can easily set all to the same.
    - alternate finale-like note entry: hold down step key to set step and
      turn on edit mode, but only while the key is down
      (merge will clip them to the next event)
  copy / paste / Clip
    - clip block should use the ruler, just to make it easier to look at
    - clip could also copy over the skeleton
      It could use it to make sure the paste is compatible, but that might
      be more of an annoyance than a convenience.

  Undo:
    - shift [ and ] undo and redo zooms.  or one key to toggle last zoom?
      . record view changes, at least zoom / scroll so it can be undone
        and redone separately
    - Suppressed undo for val edit is surprising since I tend to do a lot of
      edits without leaving val edit.  Maybe don't do it for pitch val edit.
      Try going back to using the name to suppress, but ignore cmds with no
      name.
    - Add a "revert within selection" that searches backward for the last
      change within the selection.
    - Along those lines, should each block have its own independent history?
      This is supported naturally by the git layout since each block has its own
      file.  Wait, actually it's track, and that would be awkward if I undo one
      block and it changes tracks on another.  How do a say what position
      a block is in the history in that case?
      . One appealing thing is that I don't necessarily want things like config
        changes to be included in undo.
    - Visual display of undo history, because stepping back one-by-one is
      a bit of a hassle.

Derive:
  - A block with logical range called at time 0 gets messed up.
  sekaran
    How to apply sekaran?
      . >hang -> sekar abab -> notes
      . I want to change the pattern, so the problem is how to set an env
        var for a range on one track?
      . I can add a 'sekar-pattern = abc', but I need to repeat it whenever
        there is a gap.
  fancier randomization
    . How much a note differs depends on its neighbors, so it's not an even
      distribution.  Use brownian noise, or a fractal subdivision scheme.  But
      it's also constrained in how far it can wander from the base value.
      Regardless, I think this means I need history, so it can't be
      a stateless control function.
    . Divide on instrument and hand, so each part gets its own individuality.
    - randomization should be centered on a value, with variance as a signal,
      so I can turn accuracy up or down.
    - Randomness could have some hysteresis, so I can e.g. reduce omit chance,
      but not get isolated notes.  At the extreme setting, it means it turns
      on in a slightly random spot, but stays on after that.
      . Is there a simpler way to get this effect?
  tracklang: TrackLang:
    - Keyword args.
      . A problem with environ defaulted args is that if I do e.g.
        'merge=add | a=b | block', then all of 'block' will have merge=add.
        There's no way to set it just for 'a=b'.  So they're not necessarily
        a great substitute for keyword args.  Also keyword args should
        complain if you give one it doesn't understand.
      . I think a=b syntax is available, but do I want to make a Val out of it?
        It would be resolved by Derive.Sig, and not actually make it to calls,
        but Quoted is like that too.
      . And realistically it seems really invasive to support a=b if it's not
        a Val.  But I wind up with weird things like a=b=c.
    / Pipe could be an exception to "first call is any non-space", so I can
      write a|b.  Or... is that so great after all?  With proportional fonts,
      the spaces are small and I don't want multiple ways to do it.
    generalize sub-event calls
      - Generalize sub-event calls so that they can also take block names.  This
        is just another way to write sub-tracks, perhaps more convenient if
        I want them to be independent.
      - Also generalize them so if I put it as a transformer in a track title,
        the track is treated like a sub-event call.  This way I can apply a
        transformation to the whole track without needing to wrap it with an
        event.  Paired with the Sub.modify_notes macro feature, I can have
        a track with its own little language, e.g. pakhawaj bols.
        . Could do this by making 'ctx_sub_tracks' available in the track title
          call.
        . I think there were calls in Prelude.Lily that would be interested in
          a more defined distinction between track and note level transformers.
      - Could also do a block-level thing.
    - Perhaps I should have a separation between "" as called by Util.note by
      other calls, and "" as called from the track.  The problem is that it
      applies Flags.can_cancel at TrackTime 0, which is only appropriate for
      a direct call from the track.  This is the reason for
      Gangsa.realize_notes.remove.
      . Flags.can_cancel is now obsolete, but maybe the issue still stands?
    - I was confused because I wrote '%just-base = (nn (c3))' instead of
      '%just-base = (hz (nn c3))'.  Can I use type tags to catch that sort of
      thing?
      . Hz doesn't have its own type, so it winds up being Untyped.  But any
        type can coerce to Untyped, so it can't complain if you passed NN.
        I could make Typecheck Double require Untyped, but that would break all
        the stuff that doesn't care about types.
      . Ultimately, this is because pitches take a PitchConfig, which takes
        ControlValMap, which is untyped.  I started a branch making it typed,
        but eventually lost interest since it seemed overly complicated.
    - Rethink if I really want track event calls in TrackTime, rather than
      normalized time.
      . Implementing c_sequence I was confused how stretch was applied twice,
        since Eval.eval_quoted doesn't normalize the event duration.  Same
        problem is in Gamakam2.  It's error prone that you can place the note
        via both Derive.place and via the Derive.info_event.
      . On the other hand, working in TrackTime is convenient, e.g. in gangsa
        norot I can place notes based on the passed-in dur.  If it were
        normalized, I'd have to unwarp back to TrackTime... can I even do that?
      . Details are also in "Derive.EvalTrack".
      . Adding the repeat call was unintuitive because deriver placement is
        unintuitive.
        . Ideally I could just say (0, 2), (2, 2) and it would work.
          Instead, I get (0, 8) and (2, 8)
          This is because the block isn't normalized, so stretch by 2 makes it
          4, then the stretch by 2 for the event goes to 8.
        . This is so that just 'deriver' by itself gets it right.  If I instead
          made deriver always normalized, then the above would work, but
          I would have to do 'Derive.place (Args.start args) (Args.duration
          args) deriver' to avoid it always showing up at 0-1.  And actually,
          I couldn't do that from a transformer, because what about the next
          transformer?  I should instead have each transformer be in
          normalized time.  'repeat' becomes
            [Derive.place start (1/times) | start <- Seq.range_ 0 (1/times)]
        . For blocks, it's actually almost that, except I have to translate
          back by the start time first.  This is because blocks are already
          normalized to the event duration.  I think?
    Typecheck coerces to TypedFunction as a common signal type
      - It turns out this is not so useful because a default TypedFunction
        doesn't have a default control name like a Sig.typed_control does.
        The documentation is also worse.  The way to fix this would be to
        let the default be any coercible type.  But to do that and be type safe
        I'd want a separate class for pairs of types that can definitely be
        converted.
        . Possibly a way around is to include ControlFunction in ControlRef...
          but why do I want so much to pass control functions?  Especially since
          I can already pass a concrete signal as a ControlSignal.
    . It would be nice to be able to have an arg default to ControlRef and
      have typecheck coerce to scalar via Call.control_at.  But once again the
      problem is that I can't coerce to a type different from the default.
    - if I had a boolean type, I could generalize calls in Conditional:
      . when-e key -> when (env key)
        when-e key val -> when (= (env key) val)
      . when-c 1 cont -> when (= %cont 1)
      . if-c< cont 1 a b -> cond (< %cont 1) a b
      . However, they get more wordy, so maybe I don't want it.  E.g. for
        cond I'd actually want a 'switch %cont' and then I need either
        partially applied functions, or just write 'switch<'.
    - replace VAttributes with a general purpose VSet.
    - maybe use {} for quoted, it's a bit shorter than "()
    - there should be a character that triggers a parse failure, which is used
      by invalid ShowVal instances like ShowVal Pitch
    - it's confusing how some calls expect env vals like 'x = 1' and some
      expect controls like '%x = 1'.
      . The obvious way to solve this would be to merge env vals and controls,
        but that's a big change.
    - Track caching is too fragile, if I add a track with scope over everything
      then I get no caching.  Instead I should cache the bottom note track, or
      perhaps every note track.  But that doesn't work because they're all
      sliced up.
  Derive.Sig:
    - Support pairs, e.g. a list of pairs of arguments.
      . many_pairs :: (Typecheck a, Typecheck b) => Text -> Parser [(a, b)]
      . Can I generalize to triplets etc. without a separate function for
        each?  Also, could I reuse many / many1?
      . Can I have a Typecheck instance for (,)?  No, becaues it comes from
        a single Val.
      . I would have to turn Sig into a real parser.
    - Try writing a new Typecheck / Sig which is a real parser.  It can have
      backtracking and nested parsers.
    - if I add an Alternative instance to Sig.Parser I can write arg parsers
      like 'Sig.many xs <|> Sig.many ys'.  I think.  If I wind up with something
      else like Derive.Call.Val.num_or_pitch it would be worth trying out.
      . E.g. Conditional.c_if_c takes: Symbol (Number, Quoted)* Quoted
      . Implement empty as pure (), then (<|>) should try left and if it fails,
        try right.  Doc is (x | y).  'some' and 'many' are like Sig.many1 and
        Sig.many, except they have to backtrack.
      . But derivation may evaluate expressions and check the type after that.
        Do I really want to do that with backtracking?
  postproc
    performance details / humanization
      - irregularize runs based on fingering patterns, e.g. groups of 3
    - retune a note depending on the previous interval (e.g. sloppy pitches
      when playing quickly)

  - consider track calls and block calls:
    note_track :: TrackTree.EventsNode -> Derive.EventDeriver
    derive_tree :: ScoreTime -> TrackTree.EventsTree -> Derive.EventDeriver
    I could use this to implement is-ly and no-ly, and also totally custom
    track types and block types.

  tempo track:
    - Nested tempo tracks at the toplevel block should normalize like they do
      when called.
    - Nested tempo tracks are probably broken for hybrid and absolute tempo.
    - Nested tempo tracks are probably also broken with a logical start.
  note calls:
    - retune call: differences based on speed should be more obvious, so that
      should also be on a curve.
    + chord calls, with automatic dyns for the notes.
      Originally I intended each note to go in its own track, with the idea
      that it takes about the same space but is more powerful and flexible.
      But it's not quite true, because the extra track is there for the whole
      block, though perhaps that's a side-effect of having blocks which are
      too large.  More compellingly, chords can automatically fiddle with dyn
      and start time, and can also interpret chord symbols.
    mridangam:
      - Perhaps mridangam should automatically transpose the octave to be within
        its range.
      - tha is too loud... I can compensate by using -, but maybe the scale is
        off.  Velocity should be logical, so if you play all at the same
        velocity it's like the same dynamic for all strokes.
        . Or I could make + be 0.5, and * be full volume.
      - perhaps only pitched notes should change with the tuning?
      - built-in sarvalaghu patterns
        - adjust to the talam
        - subdivide at slower speeds
      solkattu:
        - explicit strokes via (!) should not require a valid entry in the
          StrokeMap, so I can have irregular sequences manually, e.g.
          ta_ta.din_din.gin_gin.na_na.thom_thom
          . But I still need ones that are in the StrokeMap to use it because
            of when it's a known sequence, only with one stroke replaced.
            So it if there's no match in the StrokeMap, then use the stroke
            and move on.
          . Of course the other way to do that is just put the exact manual
            sequence in the StrokeMap, but it's a duplication, but minus
            the rests.
        - Support S2 Patterns.
        - put sep argument second, so e.g. 'tri p6 (tang.ga)', this way it
          reads forwards.
        - dinga can be realized with a light tha, so maybe I need a "light"
          modification?
        - Higher level variation, e.g. 666 666 666 -> 555 666 777 or even
          777 777 777 -> 567 876 789.  Actually the latter seems not so
          interesting.
        - Implement PatternFamilies so I can have 6 8 6 7 6 5, or even just
          distinct realizations within a single korvai.
        - Repeat oriented variation, e.g. 3 5 33 5 333 -> 333 5 33 5 3
        speed
          . I can't represent double speed without changing the talam, which
            then makes me write everything with spaces between.
          . I also can't represent a shift from kandam to chatusram.
          . It seems I could solve both by allowing the talam to change in the
            middle of a Sequence.  But I still wonder if changing nadai from
            e.g. 5 to 10 would throw off the talam calculation?  Of course I
            don't actually have a talam calculation beyond where is arudi.
          . But then when does this actually get realized?  If the main use
            now is to display as text, then it needs to go all the way
            through to [MNote], because otherwise I can't display a different
            gati in ascii.
          . Changing nadai is easy to display, just change emphasis groups.
            For speed 2, I think I would want to double the letter density.
            So they are different.
          . At Speed > S1 I can have fractional Matras.  But then I can't make
            RRests for each one, unless rests all have a duration.
          . But it's just the duration that's fractional, Matras themselves
            have variable duration.  I could say that at S2 I just fit *2
            matras in.
          . I think I can get rid of the variable karvai concept, it
            complicates alignment and doesn't seem to be that useful.
            verify_alignment should just be step through notes and complain if
            the count isn't right when I hit any alignment marker.
          . I can get rid of RealizedNotes entirely, and just have
            verify_duration.
          . This means karvai is just another kind of pattern, but I want to
            retain the distunction... or why even do that?
          . Often (always?) you count the stroke along with its duration, so
            d__ is a 3.
        - Should I change mridangam notes to be consistent with Solkattu.Dsl?
          I have to put thoppi on the left, for 'od' instead of the keyword
          'do'.  And I have to change tha to p instead of +.
        . Performance rules for variations, e.g. tk can be played kk.
        . Conditional derivation that depends on position in the tala, e.g.
          thali / khali.

      . Score integrate to convert bols to low level calls
        . Actually score integrate doesn't work like that, it just copies the
          input.  It would have to be derive integration.
      . Or maybe just interpret the bols directly, but due to context
        sensitivity they need to be all processed together, not as separate
        calls.
        . In general I don't have a way to interpret a track as a whole.  This
          is the "track call" thing I was thinking about a long time ago.
      - Add an input mode for bols.

      * kotekan ending in a unison or kempyung should sometimes have both
        instruments, but sometimes the last polos note should replace both.
        . Isn't that what 'cancel-pasasng' is supposed to do?
        . Also, in save/transcribe/bali/gabor @end-a 24t, the end of the

      - kajar: automatic hand muting as with reyong.
      - add additional legong and wayang tunings.  Probably 'tuning' would be
        the most appropriate, but it's already using for umbang/isep.  Maybe
        saih=umbang/isep?  Or keep tuning the same and use laras?  Kelamin
        would be cheeky but only appropriate to kendang and not even Balinese.
      legong scale:
        - add isep to *legong
        - pick better nns for pemero notes 4 and 7
        - dotted cipher notation should use 4 and 7 instead of 3# and 6#.
      kotekan: gangsa:
        * perhaps I should line up to the end for negative events
        / 'k//\\' can start in multiple ways, e.g. 444 or 4-4, or 434.
          . I can just chop off the front for now.
        - gangsa zero dur mutes too loud
          . Really I need loose and tight mute, but I'll have to do my own
            samples, or maybe add a loose mute as open with just envelope.
        * why is k//\\ non-interlocking giving the bottom part to sangsih?
          . It's because kotekan_irregular is designed that way, it has
            a single kotekan_unison.
        * is zero dur also mute for reyong?  I keep forgetting!
        - noltol puts a mute stroke after a final note.
          . It's becasue it has a lower threshold, but not an upper one.
            But really it's not the threshold, but the form, noltol should be
            during kotekan.  So maybe I should really build this into kotekan
            calls.
        - clip should be end-weighted.  If I used a negative duration I could
          make it based on that...
          . Wait, isn't that what Clip is?
        - zero dur note for norot destination winds up being a mute, because
          of course it is.  I want it to be {infer-duration, final}.
          . I could give it those explicitly, e.g. a 'final' call, or use
            -0 dur.
        norot:
          update reyong
            * rename kilit to norot and 'nt'
            * do the same prepare next note thing as gangsa norot
          - I only use Once for norot prepare, can I get rid of it?
          - Rename 'arrival' to 'prepare'?
        * With pitch at the beginning I actually can't express some things,
          e.g. uuau | k//\\ 5o, I can't put the dung on the beginning of the
          'k' because it's manual.  It would happen correctly if norot used
          the next pitch, and I could put the dung on the 'k' and the 'k' got
          dong from the end.
          . What happens when I need to write simple notes though?
        * negative events are convenient for the pitch, but sometimes I still
          want to control the final note.  Maybe I could still use positive
          durations, but take pitch from the end?
          . That doesn't work because slicing uses a negative event to include
            the end.
          . Maybe I could include control calls if they are -0?
          . Actually I don't understand why the negative event gets the next
            control.
            . It's because slice goes from start--next_start, which happens
              to be correct for negative events.
          . I would need Control.trim_signal to include the sample at the end,
            buts its whole job is to trim that one off.  So I think I need the
            negative duration on the event as a way to signal that I want the
            controls after the event, not during it.
          . If I did the thing where negative events are edited at their end,
            I could have a positive note at the end of a negative one.
            Negative becomes more of a flag on a note to tell it to draw and
            slice differently.  The tradeoff is that I can no longer put a
            positive note at the start of a negative one.  Even if I did, it
            would have to be zero duration and have its duration inferred.
          . The other option is to just use the "next pitch" feature to make
            kotekan calls depend on the next pitch instead of the current one.
            . This doesn't work because next pitch only works in a pitch
              track.  To make it work in a note track I'd have to evaluate the
              whole next note, or have an entirely separate way to get the
              next pitch.
            . Actually I now have this, via NotePitchQuery.
          . Solved with the new negative duration encoding.
        kotekan kernel:
          - generate all possible kernels following some playability rules,
            e.g. no more than 2 notes in a row, only one rest
            . I could then use that to automatically select a pattern for
              a given destination, with some constraints like playability from
              the previous pattern (no fast jumps), above vs. below, telu vs.
              empat.
        - in Gangsa.realize_kotekan_pattern, pass Nothing as the start to not
          limit the start
        - inst postproc can interpret +mute as either just a mute, or open, or
          in between depending on %mute.
          . Then I don't need a configurable mute for
            Gangsa.gangsa_norot_arrival.
        - control for noltol +mute dyn
        / gender norot: control for polos 234- vs. 434-
        - an optional special pattern which switching between kotekan and back,
          e.g. 112-2-2-
      wayang in octaves
        . pemade: >p=>p-umbang | >s=>p-isep
          kantilan: >p=>k-umbang | >s=>k-isep | %t-diatonic=5
        . I could do it with >wayang-both that emits >wayang-p and >wayang-k. Or
          just call the score twice, once with transpose +1 oct.
        . I definitely want two calls because then kantilan randomizes
          differently.
        . Or I could create the kantilan as a integration of the pemade, so it
          can still be modified. I think this would want a "score integration"
          which just copies and merges the events directly, and doesn't do
          the intermediate derivation.
        . I could add inst aliases, e.g. >umbang = >p-umbang, etc.
          Or a note-track call: '>umbang = "(>p-umbang)'
          This can't be done with call aliasing because it's actually
          'note-title >inst', and anyway wouldn't help with 'inst = >x'.
        . The intended way to do this is have > instrument, and then set it in
          the caller.  But then you can't put >1 inst on the same block.
        . But this way doesn't work if I want differences in the kantilan
          version.  I would have to do correspondingly more copy and paste to
          replace the bit I want to change.
        . Ideally I'd like something like integration: everything is
          duplicated with no extra work, but an integration is available to
          edit.  But it would be a kind of "deep integration", where
          I duplicate the entire structure, from score on down.  Score
          integration could theoretically do that.
      trompong: reyong:
        * instead of the awkward >kilit or the cancel range, should I do
          next note preparation as the end of the current kilit call?
        - A %damp of 0x01 is still counted as 0 due to 7-bit MIDI.  I have to
          have at least 0x02, but this seems like exposing details.
          . One way is to have a postproc ensure ==0 or >=1/127.
          . Or I could do the min thing in the performer for all MIDI.
          . Or maybe this "pick a low number" thing is no good.  I could
            have another control to turn off damping.
            . The sustain pedal, cc64, is a natural choice.
            . But CCs are global, so no good.
        - for infer-damp, also infer damp level
          . Damp gets louder when notes are closer, or faster.
        - How to configure open and closed damping?  I can currently do it
          by adding +open, but that might be too broad because it also applies
          to +cek.  Or I could always damp closed if that sounds good.
          Or I could infer it based on speed.  Otherwise, I can change the
          attr to +loose-mute or +tight-mute to explicitly configure.
        - split to ngembat, e.g.  λ 人 hmm, is there a reverse lambda?  Can
          I draw symbols reversed? 入 兩
          . There are several ngembat variations: fast:
              5 61    35 61
                 1        1
            slow:

               21      21
        - kbd entry for /, X, O, + etc.?
        kilitan: norot:
          . How to do norot for real?
            . Each voice is semi-independent, and may have different
              preparation patterns and times.  But then sometimes they
              coordinate.
            . Variations are random, but frequency is controlled by
              "kewayahan".
          variants:
            - controlled by variant control
            - omit notes
            - hardcoded variants, e.g. p1 on dong
            - Delayed note, e.g. on ding, oiioioi
            - Pickup can be iioi style, but parts that don't have the pitch
              often play the normal kilitan, or a passing tone.
          above speed threshold:
            - omit notes
            - Entirely different fast patterns.
          - Also I want to be able to control the dyn.  There should be
            a single control for +mute dyn.  Actually I already have that
            if I multiply %damp, right?  Still, explicit +mute notes and
            kilitan +mute notes are stronger than damping, so I need two
            I think.  Damping should default to a fraction of +mute dyn.
          - write an alternate style of kilitan, e.g. with a 6 note scale in
            tisram
        kotekan
          - support high dung for position 4
      gender:
        - rambat damping emulation: notes ring on by default until they can be
          damped.  Damp at the first opportunity, where opportunity is defined
          as a break with no notes for a certain amount of time.  Can only damp
          two neighboring notes at a time.
  india: gamakam:
    - I think Gamakam4 doesn't test next event pitch, e.g.
      Gamakam3_test.test_sequence on '!!-v-'
    dyn:
      - Add support for '_' and, why not, '.'.
    - '.' call on the note messes up gamakam
    - 'v' for next pitch is wrong when the next pitch isn't on a note start
    - There still seems to be a case where prev pitch is wrong, it has to
      do with a '--' event.
    - And another prev pitch bug:
      [ (">", [(0, 3, ""), (3, 1, "")])
      , ("*", [(0, 0, "2d"), (1, 0, "3s"), (2, 0, "3r"), (4, 0, "3s")])
      , ("*", [(0, 0, "!^20"), (1, 0, "!0="), (4, 0, "!=")])
      ]
      . Last note should get 3r, but instead gets 3s.
    . For the violin, I want to experiment with other controls, e.g. pitch
      slides also do less bow-force, or dyn can reduce bow-force and
      bow-speed.

    - overshoot "curve" for 'smooth': over2 over3, depending how far over
    . instead of hardcoding specific times, I should say short, medium, long,
      which can vary and have some randomization:
      . short, medium, long: -s = "(rnd low high) | -m = .. | -l = ..

  control calls:
    - signal transformations: +, *, max, min
    - saturation limit, e.g. flatten sine wave but without clipping
    - continuous tempo warping for signals
      tempo: "2" -> "1", "2", cont: "2" -> "i, 1", should emit a bent line

  control functions:
    I'm unhappy with control functions in general
      . More details in BaseTypes NOTE [control-function]
      . They duplicate Deriver but can't use it
      . they add another layer on top of controls that you have to take into
        account manually.
      . Also, depending on the pos means the signal is no longer a continuous
        function, and can't be displayed as a line.
      . Making calls all take Call.Function was my attempt to abstract that
        away, but I wound up giving up on that because then the default of an
        optional arg would have to be a Function which is then unshowable.
        To solve this I would have to make a total 'coerce' for Typecheck.
      uses:
        . Randomization, with various ranges and distributions.
        . Some CFs like cf-swing could just be another signal, I only do it as
          a function for efficiency, which is due to my choice to make signals
          fully sampled.
        . A way to pass an interpolation function.  This is a disjoint use
          since it doesn't need any of the BaseTypes.Dynamic state and isn't
          useful as a normal CF.
    - Could use rank to modify dyn and emphasize or de-emphasize notes on
      important beats.
    . With 'real' and 'score' and the signal conversion functions, I gradually
      rewrite more and more functions from Deriver to functions with a
      TrackLang.Dynamic argument.  Also they're going to start to want an
      exception, and why not logging too, and I'm right back to Deriver.
    . Why can't I make ControlFunction into a Deriver?
      ControlFunction moves to Deriver.Monad, so Val must also.
      Now control function stuff must be exported from Deriver, not TrackLang
      and Score.  But also Val can't be exported from TrackLang, and there are
      tons of users for TrackLang.Val.  Maybe I can split TrackLang into a low
      level version.  In fact I already have, everything Deriver uses
      TrackLang for can come from BaseTypes, except Typecheck.  Monad.val_call
      must move to Lib.
      . Environ, Pitch, and Val all move into Derive.  And Score.Event.
        This is getting to be pretty much everything.
      . Another option is to make Derivers polymorphic.  I can put the
        fields in TrackLang.Dynamic in a typeclass.

pitch: scales: scale:
  scales / Derive.Scale:
    - I think the symbolic pitch_note functions should use RelativePitch,
      otherwise the symbolic pitch they produce can't be parsed back in to
      produce the same pitch.
      . Demonstrate with some tests and fix if necessary.
      . For ChromaticScales and JustScales
    - TheoryFormat.make_relative_format is a confusing name because it makes
      a Format from a RelativeFormat.
    - It's confusing how the default_key is built-in to parse_key but also
      passed separately... maybe it should take a flag to say whether an error
      should become the default?
    - Strip type prefixes from Pitch.Pitch and Pitch.Degree?  Add lenses?
    - add ratio transpose signal, that multiplies hz
    support scales that are different ascending vs. descending
      . Scales have two versions of each degree.
      . scale_input_to_note takes a previous Note arg, which it can use to
        guess the appropriate variant.
      . Variants have to have unambiguous names though, maybe 4n^ and 4n_
      . Use scale_alternate to switch a note between alternates, bind to the
        same key as enharmonic.  If there are no enharmonics, then fall back
        on alternate.
    Raga
      - Support arohana and avarohana by treating them as enharmonics
        Is this really a good idea, since they aren't anything like
        enharmonics?  Maybe I should just use the flip-enharmonic key, but
        keep the concept separate.
        . I could keep it at the Cmd level by remembering the last entered
          pitch and defaulting this one based on it, or I could try to put it
          at the Derive level too by having the pitch itself be based on the
          previous one.
        . Putting it at the derive level seems really hard and unreliable, so
          I should have separate symbols, e.g. 4r^ and 4r_ for up and down
          variants.  For western modes this isn't necessary since the notation
          is already absolute.

    - letter and jianpu but with implicit accidentals based on the key
  intonation: think about how to do e.g. meantone melody, with just harmony
    . Do a postproc to analyze simultaneous notes.  If I use an attr to
      tag the melody, I can tune everyone else to it.  But how do I retune
      notes with non-trivial pitch curves?  Well, I could use a transpose
      signal to tell the pitch calls what's going on.  I think I might just
      need the frequency of the melody note.
    . Do an analysis pass, and insert environment that says what the harmony
      is.  Then pitch calls use that to tune.  Doing the analysis might be
      tricky since I have to extract a "principle pitch" from each event,
      but it might be useful in general to have an analysis framework.

signal: PSignal:
  / The Signal / PSignal divide can be annoying.  If I put them in
    a TimeVector class then I should be able to directly apply TimeVector
    functions to them.  Then, make all TimeVector functions polymorphic, and
    Signal and PSignal can just re-export them.
    . But it seems weird that Signal functions work on PitchSignals, so maybe
      I should specialize them before re-exporting... but that winds up being
      not much less work than unwrapping the newtype.  The advantage is that
      I can write functions generic on the signal, but in practice there are
      few of those.  So maybe I don't actually care that much.

Perform:
  - Overlapping notes with different ControlSwitch cc numbers should share
    a channel.  Of course it'll work anyway if only one channel is
    allocated.
    . Currently they definitely won't, because the performer assumes that
      all controls affect the sound, and so you can't share with any control.
  - Pick the best channel instead of the first one.
    . An event can share a channel if it has different controls but the events
      don't overlap.  This is required so that a sequence of notes that each
      set a different control will go on the same channel.  But since it always
      picks the first usable channel, you can have controls trade channels,
      depending on how the coincident events are sorted:
        [(0, 1, c1), (0, 1, c2), (1, 1, c2), (1, 1, c1)]
      This should put the c1s together, but they will trade channels if they
      come in that order.
    . I think to fix this I'd have to have can_share_chan return
      Left fail_reason or Right priority, and pick the highest priority.
      It would have to give a lower priority to events that could share, but
      have incompatible controls just out of the event range.
    . let f = Perform.shareable_chan
      let mkevent start controls pitch =
              Perform.Event inst1 start 0.33 controls
                  (Signal.signal [(0, pitch)]) DeriveTest.fake_stack
      let pedal = Map.fromList [("pedal", Signal.signal [(0, 1), (6, 0)])]

  - I can work around the pianoteq tuning bug by not stripping redundant
    conrol changes.  This also means that recorded MIDI can be played from any
    point.  If bandwidth isn't a concern then why not?
  - damper pedal causes all notes to extend until the pedal comes up, should
    the performer know about that?  Is there anything that this breaks?
    I don't think so, it affects channel allotment so notes could be
    improperly joined, but mixing pedal and multiplexing seems rare enough.
  - Perform.Midi.Perform: should be possible to lead keyswitches as long as
    they don't precede the previous NoteOn, since I think samplers will only
    switch on the next NoteOn

Util.Format:

    problems:
      . Missing close paren after wrapped constructors.
      . If I add an indent after each constructor then I get tons of indents.
        What I really want is a way to collapse multiple constructor calls

OSC backend

jack: JACK: linux midi:
  bugs
    - something is still wrong, I get "no space in output port" and then
      corrupted output
    ? jack1 doesn't work at all: other clients don't see writes, until I quit,
      and then they get continuously spammed.  Apparently the jack_port_t*
      from the registration and the lookup are different.
      - Try stashing port from port_by_name port instead of jack_register_port.
  - does jack not support sysex at all?  Maybe I can't use it at all then.
  - Ensure that shutdown stuff is being called correctly.  I don't care but
    maybe JACK does?
  use jack transport
    I don't think I need to be the master.
    - When starting a play, call jack_transport_locate,
      then jack_transport_start().  The play then blocks on a lock which is
      released by JackSyncCallback when it gets a JackRolling state.
    - Register with jack_set_sync_callback.  JackSyncCallback sets a syncing
      flag, emits a Msg that forces the needed bits of performance, then that
      cmd must call back and reset the flag, at which point the sync function
      can return true.
    Then the next step is to test, and then figure out a way to get ardour to
    automatically set up a bunch of instruments and make MIDI in ports for
    them.

misc ideas:
  . What would a generalized staged evaluation system look like?
    E.g. evaluate note (start, dur) and first pitch track.  Then go through
    again and evaluate the rest of the tracks.  The second time the
    neighbors are now incomplete Score.Events with timing and pitch.
    I would also flatten out the block structure and cancel weak notes so
    I have access to true next and prev.  This implies some way to stash the
    unevaluated tracks in the Score.Event.  Then a postproc pass would go
    through and evaluate again, providing new context to the unevaluated bits.
    . I already have something vaguely like this in the Inversion dynamic
      state.  I can provide new context with Dynamic... though it would be an
      essentially untyped way to do it since there's no type difference
      between the first and second evaluation.
    . At the moment I don't need a generalized solution, so I could just
      hardcode:
      event_stage2 :: Maybe (([Score.Event], [Score.Event]) -> NoteDeriver)
      Then at conversion time, any event with an event_stage2 is replaced by
      its evaluation.
    . Conversion isn't quite right, because I still want next event on track
      etc... but actually no, I've been here before.
    . Then I need some way to specify notation that wants to wait until
      conversion.  I guess it would go by track, so maybe a magic symbol in
      the track title.  Then slicing separately returns slices from those
      tracks.  These still have to be evaluated in their original environment,
      so I then wrap in a derive_tracks and store as a NoteDeriver.
    . So I think this could work... but is it really worth it?  It seems like
      it introduces a whole new level of complexity.  And, if I go the
      typesafe route, a whole new type of calls, which a new accompanying
      namespace.
  . Import or trace curve from a pitch tracker into the pitch track.
  . Staff notation represents chords well, but tracks don't.  Think of a more
    compact notation.
  . Why can't I write a 'tr' that generates pitch signal in some cases, and
    adds an attribute in others?  It would be redesigning control tracks so
    they are just note tracks that slice their children and apply
    a transformer to them.  I'm not sure that will coexist with the curve
    description language that control tracks currently implement.
    It would be interesting to get rid of track types entirely though.

tracklang problems
  . It's too low level for chord-oriented music like piano.  For instance, I
    have to care about which note is on which track, while staff notation
    only has one way to write the cord.  So I have to do busywork like sorting
    notes by pitch, or copy pasting notes around between hands.  The whole
    thing about "what track is it on" is a result of the proportional time
    display, otherwise the horizontal position is unnecessary complexity.
  . The way that note, pitch, and dyn are separate is a hassle for reading and
    for editing.  Automatic pitch track selection and collapsing helps a bit,
    but it's still awkward.
  . Also it's not so easy to differentiate all those tracks, especially if
    every pitch track has its dyn track.
  . It can also be complicated to copy paste around if there is a bit of
    non-trivial structure like parent note tracks.
  . It's still hard for me to see relative positions and chords just from
    text.  Staff notation seems much easier.  Also hard to see enharmonic
    spelling.
  Solutions?
    . Theoretically lilypond could give the advantages of staff notation for
      reading only, but it's too slow for realtime update.
    . So as an extreme solution I could have a high speed staff display
      of the current surroundings.  Of course all this only helps with
      reading, not writing.
    . More utils like LNote.sort_on_pitch to automate away hassle could help
      with writing, but not reading.  So maybe it's worth trying to make
      sort_on_pitch more robust.

planning / research
  text oriented score:
    . This is a pure-text score notation.  It renders down to tracklang, but
      because it's just text there has to be more complicated mechanism for
      rhythm.
    . It should also support sub-languages, e.g. pakhawaj bols.
    . There could be a text based interface that either uses a REPL or a text
      file.  This would be basically just 'seq' without any open windows.
    . Scores in this notation should be fully compatible with tracklang, and
      it should be possible to integrate into a block.
    . However, it can represent things that are awkward in the gui score,
      such as truly per-note controls and lots of use of parent tracks.

  things for expressive music
    There needs to be some way for notes to affect surrounding notes.  For
    example
      . A trill might want to push the next note back a bit so it can complete
        its cycle.
      . Portamento might want to put controls points on a curve, so the speed
        a distance between pitches affects how quickly they approach, and
        quick notes will have less accurate pitch.
      . Gender tick affects the damping of the previous note.
      . If I control uses bezier curves, the curve is determined by the last
        control point of the previous and the first point of the current call.
    Other ideas:
      . Switch samples when played quickly.
      . Drum thing where successive strokes lose some energy.
    . Randomization is a first step, but true variation in playing is not
      random.  Things to study:
      . Tempo variation.  This is related to intentional tempo variation, but
        there should be slight tempo variations all the time.  This also has
        to do with higher level controls like rushing or lagging, and slight
        amounts of swing.
        E.g. some instruments may tend to rush when they want to be more
        prominent, or get louder.
      . Start / duration variation.  Related to tempo but at a lower level and
        less systematic.  Interpretation of staccato depends on surrounding
        tempo.
      . Dynamic variation.  Many instruments tend to get louder at higher
        pitches.  Tempo speed up tends to increase volume.
      . Pitch variation.  Some instruments tend to attack inaccurately and
        then correct.  Higher dynamics and tempo could make pitch less
        accurate.
    Modelling notation as a set of constraints:
      Notation specifies parameters along with how "fixed" they are.  For
      example, specified pitches are usually immovable, but onset time might
      be variable, depending on how important the beat is.  Higher level
      notation then assembles components and combines the constraints, and
      results in either conflicts, or a set of more specific constraints.

      . Example: janta attacks from below, normally one diatonic step, but
        avoids repeating the previous note.  A trill can end on either low
        or high, but if followed by janta, will change to avoid making janta
        repeat a note.  If trill speed is unfixed, it can change that,
        otherwise change attack time of the following note.  If the trill end
        is fixed, then the grace note must adapt by picking another higher
        note.
      . Carnatic ornaments change when time is reduced.

  think about grammar for ornaments
    . Notes have a syntax: there are ornaments or articulations only valid at
      the attack time, ones that apply to the sustain, and ones that serve as
      transitions to the next note.  Also, the shapes of ornaments vary based on
      the note or absence of a note preceding and following, in addition to the
      speed.  It makes me think of cursive Arabic, where letters change shape
      and placement based on the previous letter, along with rules about which
      letters go where in the word (I'm sure linguists have a name for this,
      e.g. English has "ng", but won't start a word with it).  I've noticed
      there's a tension between specifying exact times via a timeline or
      whatever, and the kind of higher level flexibility implied by a syntactic
      approach.  E.g. if you say "attack X, sustain Y, end with Z", you are not
      saying exactly when X, Y, and Z start and end, and they are free to
      arrange themselves according to context.  But you do need a certain amount
      of precise control over times, at least in some cases.
    . This is similar to the "constraints" idea, at least with regard to some
      aspects being flexible, while others are fixed.  For instance, if
      I write ornaments with no specific times: 'A; B; C' then the start times
      and durations are flexible, and its up to the interpreting code to
      arrange them, but if I make separate events for A, B, and C, then the
      times are fixed.  Of course I also want to be able to fix A and C, but
      leave B's position flexible.
    . How to represent this as events?  I think I need a "macro" facility,
      where a call can interpret following events as a separate mini-language.
      I used to have this, and could probably get it back, by re-introducing
      the "skip following events" return value.  In that case, some notation
      like a leading '=' would indicate that the start time is fixed.
      Otherwise, the event_start is irrelevant except that it's in between
      the previous and next events.
    . Or maybe I do it as sub-notes, that way the one on the left specifies
      the extent of the "note DSL", and I don't need a "skip following" hack.

  . Composition of score fragments.  Similar to the note grammar thing, this
    is a sublanguage, so I can sequence movements or sections without worrying
    about their timing.  It simply derives each one and concatenates them.
    I could implement it as a "sequence" note transformer call.

  . Give a visual indication of the events emitted by a call.  This is the
    note level version of the track signal render.  The underlying problem is
    that textual call names are not necessarily very clear about what the
    notes are, especially if it's a relatively ad-hoc call.  But I think
    I need a fancier GUI for this, since I'd have to have some way of turning
    a bunch of events into a distinctive looking graphic, e.g. a scaled down
    image of the block or something.
