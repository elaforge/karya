UNSORTED
  - I'd like to make a local scale derived from another one but some notes
    missing, and have input and transposition skip those.
    . Ideally it could be a modifier to any scale, so it would modify input
      and transpose accordingly.  Symbols remain the same.
    . I'm still unhappy with the Scale.Make Make|Simple thing.  Returning
      Scale from a val call would be better, but I think that runs into the
      big Derive / Val circular dependency problem.
    . Do as a Make for now.
  * Someday switch UiTest.EventSpec to use Text.
  - Bind keys to Edit.insert_block_time and Edit.delete_block_time?
    . Or a key to expand the selection to all tracks?
    . A downside is that I might want to go back to my original selection.
    . Would it be useful to have an undo stack for selections?  I could also
      do things like select to end of track, delete, then go back to the
      selection.  This is like ^o and tab in vim.
  - Undo stack for selection.
    . For drags, don't record until mouse-up.
    . ^o is still available, but it would become alt-o on linux.
    . Also this tracks focused ViewId and focus changes.
  - Integrate from dsl.
    . I'd like to be able to edit e.g. solkattu dsl, then save triggers
      a score integrate.
    . This is also the way to get text language to integrate in general.
    . Also it's visualization for text language.
    . StateConfig can have 'dsl_integrate :: Map Symbol Code', then repl cmds
      to edit them.  This is then haskell, which means I need some way to get
      it into the REPL, and some standard environment in which it is executed.
    . I can actually do this currently but I have to run a repl cmd, e.g.
      LSol.integrate Score.xyz
    . So simpler way would be to hook the editor so it does 'send ...' on
      save.  I should do that first, and think about a more automatic way
      if it's too awkward.
    . The common building block is a manual score integrate like
      integrate :: Symbol -> Track [Ui.Event] | Block Ruler [Ui.Event]
    ? Remind myself about how score integrate works.
      . Manually call LIntegrate.score_block
      . Which sets (source_block, ScoreDestinations []) on the dest block.
      . score_track adds (source_track, ScoreDestinations []) to dest
        block_integrated_tracks.
    . Dsl integration won't have a source track or block.  Instead it needs
      another ID which can link it with the source.  So for code it would be
      defining file or expression.  I also need identifying stacks for the
      generated events.

    . I have to load the module with the dsl.  If that's supposed to be
      per-score then I need to get that into an .hs file and get the repl to
      add that to the targets.  The file should be .hs and loadable anyway so
      I can use ghci on it.
    . But I'll likely have multiple DSLs, so 
    . Two cases: EDSL means it's haskell with a special "prelude", like
      solkattu.  DSL means text with a parser.
  - ControlFunctions are still super confusing.
    . E.g.  '%strength=.5 | %strength=(cf-rnd ...)' means it looks like
      %strength is .5, but it's actually not, and the only way to get rid of
      the CF is %strength=_.
    . Also the whole implementation is a mess.  Isn't there some other way to
      randomize signals?
    . I could pass a Quoted, and then control functions are val calls that
      return Quoteds: (cf-rnd control 0 1)
    . Then I want to be able to treat those as signals, or coerce them both
      to the same thing.  Really that's a SignalFunction, or maybe just
      RealTime -> Deriver Y.  So this turns into the problem of how to coerce
      various types into SignalFunction, but not have to have an opaque
      SignalFunction for all the defaults.
    . I could have a Convert typeclass.  In fact maybe it would be cleaner to
      split Typecheck and Convert?
      Typecheck: Val -> Maybe a, Convert: a -> b
      Convert would be: Int -> SignalFunction.
    . I think this won't work because the intermediate 'a' will be
      ambiguous.
    . I can always have a Default class that is used only for Sig defaults,
      and provides both ShowVal and the coercion.  It would mean I have to
      duplicate everything in Typecheck, unless I use an overlapping
      typeclass.  Or I could default to... what exactly?
    . The problem with `Convert a b` is that 'a' needs a type annotation,
      which would make signatures annoying to write.  Normally I don't need
      them because they are the Typecheck val, which already needs to be
      fixed.
    . Or I could have defaults be either a Typecheck val, or
      (Doc, Typecheck val), and then have an explicit constructor for Function
      which promotes various types to (Doc, Function).
  - bug: Track 'mute' status gets increasingly off.  Surely this is due to the
    bug fix in c523680838564ec55752302d1d591482971b9190 where I no longer do
    only absolute updates to the skeleton.
    . Can't reproduce this now.
    . It happens in save/bali/kebyar-duduk, e.g. mute reyong part in @b3
  - bug: I still get stuck mutes, e.g. ugal in semara-dana, @dim-pok
    . Also telek ugal, before pengawak.
    . I think it's still kontakt's fault, since if I record in reaper and play
      back I get non-deterministic results.  Try moving the keyswitch back
      again.
  - Add 'angklung' and 'beleganjur' scales.
  - BaliScales should have a default ombak, depending on laras.
    - Also there should be a way to randomize per instrument, so it's not too
      perfect.
  - Disallow 4e# in selisir.  And generally accidentals.
    . Validating the absolute pitch is broken for *legong, because I want to
      make sure the relative pitch is in the key's intervals.
    . I could make validation more complicated, but I think not using
      ChromaticScales would also fix this.
    . I don't get an error because the pitch is created, but will evaluate to
      UnparseableNote, which makes an error only on conversion.
    . It's because ChromaticScales reads a relative pitch, and only checks
      for validity once it's absolute, at which point it already created
      a ScaleDegree.  I could either also validate relative, or get rid of
      the fancy ChromaticScales use for scales without modes.
    . Or maybe UnparseableNote should have a msg arg to show what it was?
    . The thing is, I don't want the whole accidental parsing mechanism,
      I just want 7 symbols, and a relative pitch system.
    . So I could have a simplified ChromaticScales which dispenses with letter
      + accidental, and instead just has a unique name for each scale degree.
    . Then I could use 1234567 for javanese-style notation.
    . I'd basically replace the show/read pitch stuff with a hardcoded map to
      RelativePitches.
    - I can't have different pc_per_octave based on key, without parsing
      the key in input_to_note.
  - It would be nice to have a no-keys version of BaliScales so I don't have
    to mess with a fake key in *selisir and *wayang.
    . I guess it's not a big deal, but at least it means it ignores key.
    . Actually it seems like it might be a pain, because then I can't use
      the same Config.
  Why are scales so complicated?
    - Can I make it simpler?  If I were to rewrite it knowing all this stuff,
      what would it look like?
    . twelve: Keys have mode and tonic, so each key has a signature that
      influences enharmonic spelling.  Has accidentals with enharmonic
      spelling, and a layout which says which pitches are skipped, also based
      on the key.  Both the pitches and accidentals are absolute and so
      independent of the key.
    . twelve-k: Like 'twelve', but while pitches are still absolute,
      accidentals are relative to the scale.
    . twelve-r: like 'twelve', but both pitches and accidentals are relative
      from the key's tonic.
    . just: Keys have mode and tonic as with 'twelve', but they affect the
      tuning.  The layout is diatonic in that there are no skipped pitches,
      and hence no enharmonics and accidentals.  Accidentals are supported
      just as a constant ratio offset, so respelling enharmonics will change
      the frequency.  Since there's no per-key spelling, the key is much
      simpler, just a tonic pitch.
    . just-r: Like 'just', except that pitches and accidentals are relative to
      the tonic.
    . raga: Like 'just-r', except with a much larger selection of modes.
      Also, instead of accidentals, there are multiple candidates for
      certain pitches (e.g. ri1 ri2 ri3), where one will be default based on
      the key.  TODO the last bit is not implemented yet.
    . legong, pelog: These have keys, but like 'just-r', they are simply a
      starting note (tonic) and a layout to indicate skipped notes.  However,
      there are no accidentals, and instead each note has a unique name.
      'legong' (but not 'pelog') has a 'tuning' which indicates pengumbang or
      pengisep, and they also have a 'laras' value, which indicates the tuning
      variant.
    . legong-pemade, legong-kantilan, etc.: Like 'legong', but with octaves
      relative to the tessitura of a particular instrument.
    . selisir, wayang:
    . selisir, wayang -pemade etc.: Relative octave variants.
    . belaganjur, angklung:
    misc notes:
      . Simplest is an absolute scale with no key and no octave structure, just
        a mapping from symbol to pitch.
      . Then we have a relative diatonic scale.  This has a key which influences
        the note names, since they are relative to a certain pitch, but no other
        structure.
  - Legong scale umbang and isep is too close.
    . Maybe something wrong with how I retuned the sc gamelan samples.
  - TSymbol could have a descriptive arg with e.g. instrument, scale, etc.
  - OutOfRange pitch error should show the pre-transposition pitch.
    . In fact, all the errors from e.g. Pitches.pitch_nn should be annotated
      with information about the pitch.
  - entering negative events is awkward
    . If I enter a long note and shorten it, I lose the pitch?
    . I think I lose the pitch when I enter a positive note afterwards, or
      delete one.
    . It's confusing how entry is at the beginning, and appears in the wrong
      place.
    . Non-point select should not get -0 at its start.
    . Set duration doesn't work when there's positive and negative together.
    . Using ^G to flip orientation tends to wipe out the pitch event.
    . Also I want to be able to put an explicit note at the start of
      a negative event, e.g. |<--|.
    . I could still conceivably use real negative durations by keying on
      (TrackTime, Bool).  Then I could edit them by giving the selection an
      orientation.  It would have to switch with a key, or I could have 'w'
      and 'b' automatically switch.
    . Suppose the selection could be either negative or positively oriented.
      Maybe I could even use it for e.g. set duration vs. set begin, and move
      up vs. move down.  It would have to be easy to switch directions though.
  * Replace global transform with UiConfig.ky
    . I could implicitly wrap everything in 'global', and set it with
      "note transformer: global = ...".
    . The only thing is that this doesn't display so compactly in logview.
      But it's not like I look at that a lot anyway.
    . Maybe call at 'GLOBAL' so it's visually distinct.
    . This once again changes randomization because a new GLOBAL in the stack.
      How can I stop doing that?
    . I could add a hack to skip it.  It works but is obviously not
      a general solution.
    . I could mitigate by not including calls, just blocks and tracks and
      region.  That way just setting an env var won't change everything under
      it.  Is there a case where I would want it to be different but isn't?
  - Cmd.Ky: Keep the defining file in a special slot in the call doc, so I can
    print it out in shadowed msgs.
  - Cmd.Backend's Midi.Patch is redundant, since the Inst already has it
    . Not quite, since Backend encodes that alloc and patch backends are
      equal, but is it really necessary?
  - do a renaming pass on all the prev/next pitch function names in Derive.Args.
    . Should Prelude.Pitch.approach use the lookup pitch style?

  - it looks like special kajar calls like 'oo' mess up track signal.
    . I can fix 'oo' by making DUtil.doubled_call inverting, but that doesn't
      work for 'o..'.
    . DUtil.multiple_call doesn't need inverting because it dispatches to
      call that do invert, right?
    . Actually it's pretty pernicious, because without inverting, doubled_call
      will still appear to work because the underlying call inverts.  But
      TrackSignal gets messed up, and if it did anything based on controls
      then they would not take child controls into account.
    . Why is TrackSignal messed up though?
  - do nruk with a static macro
    alias 'o..' 'nruk | o'
    . I could modify c_nruk to have a generator version that takes a deriver,
      but then I have to copy paste it.
    . How can I inherit args?  StaticMacro is no good because I want the
      generator to be late bound.  But 'nruk' should be static bound because
      it's in another module and I want to inherit its args.
    . What I really want is to inherit args and docs from the transformer, and
      apply to the generator dynamically.  So something like a static macro
      where I give all args to one transformer, and the generator is dynamic.
      I think I can do the former with a special arg, and the latter with an
      eval "static call".
    . But what happens with StaticMacro when it hits a Sig.many?  I think it's
      broken.
    . To support this, Sig.required_vals needs to support 'many' parsers.
      I could infer from ArgParser but it seems like it's getting too
      complicated.  I think at that point I had better just be able to copy
      the parser over.  Can't I just reapply to the callee?
  - charukesi: fltk/EventTrack.cc:109 sample time didn't increase: 37.2 <= 37.2
  - Use kotekan for >wy with sargam scale.
  - I should collapse adjacent Collapsed tracks so they don't turn into
    a giant blue block.
    . If I do it at the fltk draw level, then I don't have to worry about diff
      complications or tweaking indices, but I still have to model as fewer
      widgets so the index tweaking just happens lower down.
    . If I do it at the haskell level, hopefully I can reuse the existing
      Track / DisplayTrack distinction used for collapsed tracks in the first
      place.
    - I have to also collapse the skeleton, which means I need
      a Block.display_skeleton and Block.display_integrate_skeleton.
    . However, I'm not sure it's worth it.
  - The error selection is still hard to see on a busy block, I usually have
    to zoom in and do it again.
    . I think to be more visible it would have to blink or somehow be larger.
      Ideally I could have some kind of glow
      Or maybe red is just overused, if it were green or blue?
  vsl:
    - figure out how to do tuning
      . I think it needs to be pitch bend, since it doesn't seem to respond to
        MTS.  But VSL ensemble should be able to load multiple copies of the
        patch and share sample data.
      . Figure this out before doing too many more patches, because I'll have
        to update them all with global control config, unless there's a way
        to copy paste that.
      . However, it apparently can be used with hermode, so not sure how that
        happens.  Maybe I can just ask VSL support.
      . Scala files are not very good because I'd have to go manually load
        them every time, and they're static.
    . Legato attack scale control affects the crossfade level of interval
      samples, experiment with that.
      . Wait, where did this go?
    . figure out how perf reps work, and how I should handle them
    - make sure perf_upbeat_repetitions are consistent
    - make sure grace vs. grace.updown is correct
    attribute groups:
      . bass clarinet has nv without vib
    - rename +sec# to +s#?
  - Sortedness tracking for Stream and Post functions.
    . Track down usage of Stream.from_sorted_list, probably most uses are
      bogus.  Stream.from_list and Stream.from_events have to take
      Score.Events so they can sort them.
    . Sorting vensions of Post functions also have to return Score.Events to
      be able to sort them.  They could take another event_of, but it seems
      like there should be a way to compose the mapped functions instead of
      the maps.
    . I should also come up with a plan for deforesting the intermediate
      lists.
    . Order is easy to check with quickcheck.  I could come up with some ways to
      do quickchecks on certain score fragments.  Or alternately, apply
      a standard set of checks: start =0, >0, in callee block, etc.
  - Perf.lookup_instrument on a pitch track could look at its note track.
  - I forgot to add Sub.inverting to mridangam.p1 and mridangam.pn calls.  Can
    I have a warning for when a non-inverting call has a note track below it?

  - empty track doesn't get an Environ, which causes Cmd.Track to not be able
    to find the instrument.
    . It was because the kendang tracks were below >pno, not "tempo".  So, two
      problems:
      . It's too hard to see that the skeleton is wrong.
      . Note track children should have dynamics too.
  - Do I need Perform.perform_control_msgs.trim or not?  Figure it out and
    write a test if I do need it.
  - fix control scope in parent events that cover up an orphan, as
    demonstrated in Sub_test.test_overlapping_parent_control_scope
  - Better solution for the "sample at end of block" problem, as demonstrated
    by Block_test.test_trim_controls_problem
  wayang
    - Infer late damping.  E.g., if there is a jump wider than 2 notes, then
      wait until the hand is free for long enough to damp it.
    - Automatically fill in weak notes?
      . This also applies to reyongan, even more so.
      . In fact this is similar to noltol.
    - many double strikes or ngoret tones land a bit ahead of the beat
    - I want some optional ngoret to happen the same way in both hands.
      I could make it apply to a parallel kempyung or octave.
      . I'd need a fancier ngoret that understands 'inst-top' so it can go
        down if necessary.
  - thru on *legong notes is wrong the first time
    can see this editing rehearsal/kendang-legong
  / can I make Edit.cmd_set_duration use alter_duration?  Also, why do I need
    modify_event_near_point, doesn't ModifyEvent.selection already do that?

  - %sus-abs=-.x is not quite right for detached, because it should scale
    a bit for shorter notes.  E.g. it's absolute but scales down to 0 below
    a certain threshold.

  - network midi doesn't seem to handle abort?
    playing the second time doesn't happen
  - I have a feeling like FM8 doesn't obey ResetAllControls
    Maybe I should extend Midi.Interface.note_tracker to keep track of
    used CCs to issue resets for them.  Some reset to 1, e.g. cc2 and cc7,
    the rest reset to 0.

IN PROGRESS
  * Make negative events less awkward. Make selection directional, and key
    events on (TrackTime, Orientation), so I can have |<--|.
    . branch directional-select
  - Make BaliScales which are not saih pitu be fundamentally diatonic, not
    just degenerate chromatic.  Or figure out how to simplify the whole scales
    mess.
    . branch: bali-scales
  - rewrite shakefile so I can disable features like 'im' and not require
    their dependencies for tests, haddock, etc.
    . branch shake-targets
  - Extend TimeVector with an offset, so I can get rid of
    Score.event_untransformed_controls and the like.
    . branch signal-offset
    . After this I'd like to make Score.Event's fields private so e.g.
      I can enforce set_instrument.
    . Also simplify or unify various types in Derive.ScoreTypes,
      Derive.BaseTypes, and Derive.Score.  Maybe get rid of type aliases
      and move simple types to Derive.T.
  * Make solkattu use a generalized rhythmic framework, and support speed and
    nadai change.
    . branch solkattu
  - Complete Util.PrettyGeneric so I don't have to hand-write Pretty
    instances.
    . Maybe I should fix the formatting bugs first.

TASKS:
  Performance
    . Solve input lagginess when the score is large.
    . Reduce GHC-API memory usage: 'Reduce memory used'
    . Look for memory leaks.
    . Make transformers lazy so they can interleave, aka
      map f . map g -> map (f.g)
  Music / design / language:
    . Clean up tracklang type checking.
    . Music Analysis: Look for repeats or repeats with transposition.
    . Text score.
    . Solve how timing changes bubble up.  Text score can do it, or maybe
      integrate from DSL (either text score or haskell) or have a purely
      read-only block or track.
    . Simplify scale implementation 'Why are scales so complicated'
    . Something better than ControlFunctions for randomized signals.
      . Could be figure out the Sig.Parser defaults, e.g. Typecheck or Convert.
    . Negative events, negative selection.
    . Im
  Tests:
    . Quickcheck for derivation.
    . Test Ui.Diff and Ui.Sync.
    . Properly parallelize tests.  Maybe use a Test monad instead of IO and
      make tests pure.
  . fix bugs in Util.Pretty / Util.Format
    . Or use someone else's library... printcess?
      . Looks like it only has one level of indentation.  Also I think it
        doesn't have breaks, it just always breaks on space.  And uses String.
  GUI:
    . Prettier events, smooth scrolling etc.  OpenGL?
    . TrackSignals could use y position and color / transparency.
    . Window management: automatic tiling, window manager configuration.
  Linux:
    - Increased scroll sensitivity for the scroll wheel.  Or is that an
      X config?

solkattu branch:
  * Make generalize Sequence module with just the rhythmic part.
  . I can't reduce to Duration before formatting because I don't have
    fractional spacing, so I actually want to do spacing based on nadai, not
    absolute timing.  This is in conflict with treating 's (-1) (a.b)' the
    same as 'a.__.b.__', but presumably I could do a simplification step that
    looks for such binary reductions.
  . Can't I still flatten the notes?  It's awkward to find subsequences in
    nested data.  And once I'm in realize, I don't care about dropM stuff.
    If I realize by inserting Tempos into a flat stream, then I can do both
    format and realize to Duration as necessary, and the stream is still flat.
  * Realize.Patterns should map to Sequence.Notes for tempo changes.
  * Fix tests.
  * It seems like realize_patterns destroys the tempo?
    . Do tests that check that.

  * Document structure:
    Realize -> Solkattu -> Sequence -> Tala

selection-orientation branch:
  . How should selection work?
    . Events fully within the selection are affected no matter what.
    . An event with its trigger at the beginning or end of the selection is
      affected based on the selection's orientation.
    . A point selection affects events at the point and with the same
      orientation.  If there is one with the wrong orientation, select that.

    . If events have orientation, do I need orientation on the selection?
      I do need some way to say if I'm editing the positive or negative if
      both coincide, but for a range I think I can just say get a positive
      event at the beginning, and a negative one at the end.
  . Events.split puts a negative event in pre.  Will that lead to confusing
    results, or expected ones?  At least for Factor.split_time_at it seems to
    be right, since the negative one will go before.
  . So can I go back to negative durations for events?  I think so, and in
    fact orientation is only needed to differentiate 0 and -0.  Maybe I could
    even make a newtype around ScoreTime for that?
    . No wait that's totally wrong, the negative is in the duration.
    . It's just that the event itself should now have a negative duration
      again, instead of Event.orientation.  Or rather, Event.orientation
      calculates from the duration.
  * Selection.events takes the previous event for point selection, but could
    take the next one for Negative orientation.
  * Add visual orientation to fltk and Selection type.
  * Add orientation to haskell Selection.
  Add orientation support to Cmd.Selection.
    * Make orientation affect selected events.
    * Test that selection orientation works, in Cmd.Selection_test
  Cmd.Edit
    * Compile
    * Fix definitions
    * Tests.
  * Ui.Events events keyed by (Orientation, TrackTime).
  * Fix Serialize Selection instance
  * Can't modify text on negative events.
    . Because new negative events lose to old ones.
    . I can fix it by sorting new events so they get priority.
  - It's surprising how positive always wins to negative.  This means adding
    a positive events with +END will destroy all negative ones below it.
  * Invert duration should swap the places of (n, -0), (n, 0).
  - set_duration: If I have ><---|, I can't set the negative event back to the
    zero dur event because it sets the previous positive event, regardless of
    selection orientation.
  * Floating input should be above or below depending on orientation.

  . I tend to lose -0 ScoreTime because they show up as (==).  Also can't
    test 0 vs. -0 for the same reason.  I could modify ScoreTime's Eq to
    differentiate, but then things that check zero dur with (==0) would need
    to also have (== -0).  So if it's going to be error-prone either way, I
    might as well be standard.
  cleanup:
    * highlight_errors might be hard to see now, especially if zero dur.
    * ModifyEvents.selection_expanded still has a confusing name because
      it sounds like Selection.around_events.  Maybe selection_visible?
    * Verify I can use control set at -0 and 0 to get interpolate to, then
      jump.  I think that means the specialized controls are now obsolete,
      though they might be less work to use anyway.
    - Make cmd_set_start apply to overlapping events.  The problem is that
      this makes moving event + controls messed up, so it has to do the
      ModifyNote thing.  This was broken before too.
    / Rename Event.set_start and set_end to move_start and move_end.  Set
      winds up being the lens.
    * Change Selection.get_insert to Selection.point as appropriate.
    * Selection.get should just return the selection, Selection.view can
      return (ViewId, Selection).
    / Events shouldn't export split_lists, callers can use split
      . Nah, it's useful.
    * In Ui.Event, rather than ad-hoc modify functions with hard to remember
      names, why not export lenses?
      . This will break everywhere that uses Event.start event.  Can I have
        lens variant, e.g. Event.start_?
    - Slice range should be Events.Range so it can remember the orientation.
      Otherwise I think -0 note slices don't work.
    - I think Slice.events_in_range should get an orientation, which in turn
      means checked_slice_notes needs one.  Otherwise don't negative notes
      not get the end event?  But Sekar maybe relies on include_end.
    - Perhaps related, I removed include_end since negative should work for
      that, but Sekar used it.  Can I use Sekar with negative events to get
      end bias back?
    - Remove Sel.selection constructor, record syntax is actually nicer.
    / lots of calls to Selection.tracks ignore range.  Make simpler versions?
    / Maybe the arrows should go at the top or bottom to represent range, and
      the "current" end should get a highlight to indicate where motion
      happens.
      . Now that selection orientation isn't really range orientation maybe I
        don't care so much about this.

documentation:
  - Publish haddock with http://documentup.com/feuerbach/standalone-haddock
  - Can I have Util.Linkify check the validity of single-quote links?  Or
    maybe I could run a link checker against the final output.  Otherwise
    'Module.function' references get out of date.
  calldoc: CallDoc:
    - collapse control for modules, option to collapse / expand all
      . Haddock:
        <span id=xyz class="module collapser"
          onclick="toggleSection('n.1')">Title</span>
        <ul id='section.n.1' class='show'> ...
    / put anchors on calls and make single quotes link to calls
      . It's not quite so simple because there is module, and then call type.
        So the linkifier would have to understand that structure and search
        for one, or have some javascript, and then it would have to choose
        if there is >1 match.  Too complicated.
    / For call doc, can I group calls with the same doc but different args,
      especially different defaults?
      . Would look like:
        doc doc doc generator
        bind -- name
          args
    - I could go look through arg docs for controls and list all the controls
      that have someone listening to them in a certain scope.

synth: im:
  What's the current status?
    . Cmd.Performance will serialize im notes and start the binary.
    . Synth.Sampler will read the notes and write a single wav file with
      the right start times and start pitches.
    . Cmd.Play.from_realtime can emit the im protocol from Perform.Im.Play,
      which will then play a sample, starting at the right time.
  TODO
    . Cache / incremental rendering.  Karya has to also emit damage ranges,
      and the synth has to expand that to notes and rerender just those
      sections.  play_cache has to understand the more complicated cache
      and mix or concatenate the chunks.
    . Atomic cache replacement.  The synth generates a new cache dir, and
      play_cache GCs the old one when it stops.
    . Per-instrument or per-track rendering.  The synth tags rendered chunks
      with track and instrument, karya protocal can disable, and play_cache
      omits those.
  csound backend:
    . Use csound-expression?
  ? Why does compiling build/opt/sampler compile Cmd.Cmd?
    . Because Synth.Sampler.Patch uses Cmd.InstrumentCode.
  / The start time should be in fractions of a second instead of sample
    frames, so I'm not dependent on sample rate.  Also, will I need to emit
    negative time?
    . But as long as the srate constant is shared, what's the problem?  Also,
      for negative I'd have to decide how much, and besides reaper doesn't
      necessarily have negative time.
    . So I have to add a constant anyway.
  cache / incremental rerender
    . I want the sequencer to only send the damaged range, but the synthesizer
      will have to rewind to the previous chunk boundary, since it can't just
      put every note in its own sample.  I suppose a sampler could actually do
      that, but presumably physical models couldn't.
    . Though actually a model would need to save its state at chunk
      boundaries, so if I go per-note, then I wind up with rendering each note
      separately, with a header with the model's state at start time.  But
      overlapping notes would influence each other, so it would have to be
      chunks of overlapping notes.  Of course it's not guaranteed there will
      be a gap, so it would have to break anyway over a threshold.
    . This is all to say that the cache chunks are synthesizer dependent, so
      it needs access to all the serialized notes and can rewind as much as it
      wants.  If notes are saved individually and indexed by time then I just
      need to re-save the damaged ones and either send the time range or infer
      from file timestamps.
  - If there is only one cache mutated by the synth, then a play in process
    will be spoiled by a new render.  I can fix this by making a new cache
    each time, and hardlinking the unchanged entries.  I can remove the old
    one if the play is stopped and there is a newer one, so this could be done
    by the PlayCache vst.
  - Im signals have to either be audio level, or interpolate between their
    points.  Audio rate is overkill at the sequencer level, so I think I
    make them interpolated.  But since it's ambiguous whether the sequencer
    wants interpolation or a discontinuity, I think I have to disambiguate by
    emitting two samples at a discontinuity.
    . Ideally I'd have resolution independent signals, so just functions.
      Not totally sure what that would entail, but it would be a big change.
  more efficient Perform.Im.Convert
    * Zero-copy conversion for the signals.
      . But first I have to decide how I want to handle interpolation.
      . This doesn't matter as long as the synth doesn't support signals.
    - Trim signals.

shakefile: build:
  . To get a path between two rules:
    ancestorOf('Synth/Sampler/Main') && descendantOf('Cmd/Cmd')
  - use new system calls and logging levels
  automatic "All.hs" modules
    . I'm reluctant because it's simpler to have normal files, and it's not
      that hard to update them.
    - Derive.Call.All looks for (note|pitch|control)_calls from Derive/Call/,
      but could also take from Local/Call/*
    - Local.Instrument looks for 'load' from Local/Instrument/
  - once upon a time, the shakefile took .2s to discover the build is up to
    date.  Now it's up to .7s.  Where is the time going?

incremental save / git:
  + try saving individual events for incremental save
    Seems to be just as slow as full save, probably most of the time is in
    the call to git.  Test again with larger tracks.
  - wrap operations in a lock file
  - make sure things are ok if it fails at any step
  - I don't think Ui.State needs to emit CmdTrackAllEvents for cases where
    diff will catch it.
  - See if git's delta compression understands binary and can compress
    tracks.  Otherwise, would it be worth helping it by e.g. separating
    each event with a newline?  But then it makes serializing events more of
    a hassle.

integrate / integration:
  score integrate
    - cascading score integrates
      Is there really a use for this, other than consistency?
  derive integrate
    - attrs that the instrument understands can turn into +attr calls, if
      they're not in the CallMap, e.g. save/test/wayang
    - adding a +soft stroke means it gets both less dyn and +soft again, so
      it's extra soft
    - bug: can't delete a derived track, it just gets regenerated
    - bug: can't undo past a integrate create, it just creates a new one
      Maybe I could not record the integrate step?
    - bug: create tracks, remove <, re-add <, does it work?
      Removing < should break the integrate links.
    - Ensure cascading track integration works.
    - If integrate is committing changes to a track, can that bite me if
      a "canceled" derivation comes through?  Think about this later.

lilypond:
  - lilypond: espressivo <> should be like a normal hairpin
    But the way to do this is awkward, << .. { s4 s4 \< s4 \> s4 \! } >>
    . I also want tied notes to expand to 'c4~ \< c4 \>'
      But that has problems, I need a \!.
    . Even '<< b'2.~ { s4 \< s4 \> s4 } >> | b'4 cs''4 \!'
      is not ideal, the decrescendo extends to underneath the next note.
      If I put \! on the tied-to note, it still won't extend.
    . see \at in https://github.com/openlilylib/openlilylib/tree/master/input-shorthands/articulations-not-aligned-with-notes
    . Ideally:
      a \cresc \decresc % over duration of the note
      a \cresc ~ a \decresc % same
  - Lilypond.write_empty_staff creates incorrect rests for a tuple, as shown
    in Lilypond_test.test_add_bass_staff
  - to make notes without duration, ignore the existing duration and choose
    the simplest possible duration.  For zheng, yangqin, percussion.
    . Exception for +trem
  - warning if ly-prepend or ly-append is being omitted due to a chord
  - Maybe code events with a voice should go in the voice requested rather
    than mixed into the first one.  E.g. would have fixed grace notes.
  - one track has voice, the other doesn't, causes a "can't advance time
    backward" error
  - Support ly-append-first and ly-append-last for zero-dur notes.
    . First come up with uses for them?  Or do it just for orthogonality?
  - code events in >ly-global can be distributed to all staves
    Otherwise I have to remember to add e.g. ly-key to all staves manually.
    . But ly-key is no good, I really do need to set the key.  I think I have
      to break up the block.  Why can't I do assignment more easily?
    . Well, I have to grab a deriver to dynamically scope the new value around.
      Unless I let a deriver mutate the environ, then it has to be nested.  If
      a deriver can mutate, then events have to be evaluated in order.  Of
      course, they already do for controls because of the previous sample.
      And since it's unset at the end of the block, block caching still works,
      the same way as for previous sample.
    . On the other hand, I think I want to encourage nestedness and it should
      be easy to split.  The only reason viola-sonata has huge blocks is that
      it's a midi import.
  - If I can figure out the meter from just the name, then I can get rid
    of the awkward map with hardcoded meters.
    I could have parse generate the Meter and memoize it.
  - optionally emit the lilypond to display a compound meter, e.g. 3+2/8
  jianpu
    . Research jianpu conventions, but basically:
      . Hide staff lines, stems, beams.
      . Noteheads replaced by numbers
      . Use a somewhat proportional layout.
      . Lines for 8th, 16th etc. notes.
      . Dots for octaves.
      . Stack chords vertically.
      . Grace notes as superscripts.
      . I still use lilypond's bars, slurs, tuplets, dynamics, etc.
    . http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/mwrhome/jianpu-ly.html

        principles.

negative duration / arrival beats:
  new arrival notes scheme infer-duration:
    . I don't want to trim because I might need the controls if I extend the
      duration.  I do want to trim because I don't want e.g. t-dia at start
      from the caller, but I do want pitch at start from the block.
    . t-dia:  0   1   0
              b1  b2
              a b|c   d
              a b|    d
    . If 'c' is present, then I clip off t-dia because I drop controls
      starting at 1.  The starts are replaced with ones from b1.
      So the sample at 'start' should come from the local block only.
      Samples after start can be used from global.  So what if the block
      call just deleted samples at exactly block end?  Any local tracks
      could put a sample there, but otherwise the event gets control signal
      afterwards.  If there is a note to replace, the >start samples are
      replaced, but otherwise, I get the ones from the caller.
    . E.g. global filter sweep.  A infer-duration note would stick out
      because the sweep is meant to be continuous.  In this case, I can
      just use the untrimmed control.  But t-dia should not do that, unless
      I really am treating it continuously.  This is the same problem as
      whether a control should continue changing into the decay or not.  The
      sweep should, but a pitch belongs to the next note.  So maybe this is
      a fundamental limitation of the score language.
  represent arrival notes differently
    . Instead of representing arrival notes as the sounding time plus
      a negative duration, I could represent them as a start time plus a flag.
      If the flag is set, it's considered an arrival note and the trigger line
      is drawn at the bottom instead of the top.
    pros:
      1 Cmds work the same for negative and positive durations, I don't have
        to do any special checks for overlapping with a following negative
        event.
      2 I can have a note arrive and another depart from the same point, e.g.
        trill up to a note.
    cons:
      3 The encoding seems not as elegant.  I can still do it with negative
        durations, but now the negative is just a flag, rather than
        representing the actual extent of the duration.
    4 This means that cmds work spatially rather than logically,
      i.e. I'll need a separate "set beginning" cmd since it becomes set
      duration for negative events.  I don't know if that's a pro or con, but
      it feels like a con since I need more cmds.
    #1 might not be compelling if I've already done the work to get them to
    work, but if it's buggy or turns into continual for for every cmd then it
    becomes a big deal.

local: plugins:
  I also want local code in haskell.
    . I could put code in Local.Score.SomeName, and have those either
      statically linked in, or dynamically compiled and loaded on each
      derivation.
    . Static linking is easier, but I should at least automatically create
      a All.hs.
    . Also, creating calls is a bit heavyweight, since I likely don't care
      about tags and doc and module can be inferred.  Presumably I can get
      around that with a constructor that defaults those fields, and then
      the generated All.hs overrides the module.
    . Writing in tracklang lacks typechecking.  There could be utilities to
      write like tracklang, but in haskell, e.g.
        c_p1 = with_note_call "p" "subst1" $ block "pattern"
  . ghc can now unload code: http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/8039
  . might be relevant: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/dynamic-loader
    http://codeutopia.net/blog/2011/08/20/adventures-in-haskell-dynamic-loading-and-compiling-of-modules/
  . to do per-score code, I can put it in Local.Score.<namespace>
    Convert to module name by replacing -x with (upper x) and capitalizing the
    first letter.
    Then when you load a score, incorporate the static config from that
    module.  Shakefile can link in the local modules under the right name.
    . If it gets to be too much overhead to link on every single build, then
      I can load dynamically at runtime.

cleanup:
  - switch from parsec to megaparsec?
    . Save it for a big ghc upgrade, since it requires a newer semigroups.
  - Cmds don't indicate when they could abort or throw.  I rely on ad-hoc
    conventions like get_ vs. lookup_, but what about it actually being in the
    type signature?  I could try the "lightweight checked exceptions" in:
      http://www.well-typed.com/blog/2015/07/checked-exceptions/
      https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/3g41au/follow_up_safe_lightweight_checked_exceptions/
    . Or an easier way would be to put 'throw' in a subclass.
    . I have this implemented in the p-monad branch, but it didn't seem
      terribly compelling.  I think the reason is that it turns out most
      functions can throw.  It doesn't replace get_ vs. lookup_ because they
      are likely to call something else which can throw.
  . Could I simplify slicing and inversion by making it into a score
    preprocessing step?  It would annotate UI Events with children, so the
    sub tracks would be in Event, not in Context.
    . If I could get rid of the ctx_sub_events / ctx_sub_tracks thing too that
      would be nice.
    . Could I also somehow make inversion universal?  The idea is to
      eliminate the thing where I forget to add Sub.inverting.
    . I could also take evaluation control away from the event, effectively it
      would mean the Sub.notes bit would be hardcoded and events would get
      [[Sub.Note]] instead of a TrackTree.  I'd lose power, but what are the
      advantages?
  . Things I don't like about evaluation:
    . All that stuff in Context.  The presence of sub_tracks can cause
      unexpected further inversion.  An example is that when I inherited
      the Context for Call.note_here, it also inherited the sub_tracks,
      which caused Call.with_pitch to be overridden.
    . It's also dumb how Context has the event (start, dur) duplicated
      in the 'event' field.  It's not duplicate info for track events
      because they have TrackTime, which is otherwise unavailable.
      This I think is ultimately due to events being in TrackTime
      context instead of (0, 1) normalized.
    . Maybe the problem is inheriting Context?  Or maybe it's awkward
      how it's effectively a manually passed packet of data, while the
      stuff in Dynamic is dynamically scoped.  Events wanting to know
      about their neighbors really does complicate things.
    simplify Context
      . Maybe I should explicitly provide specific bits of context, e.g.
        . prev, cur, and next event TrackTime
        . prev and next logical pitch
      . Say I do that, and put them in Dynamic.  How can I then get rid of
        sub_tracks?
      . I still need prev_val
      . There's nothing intrinsically wrong with Context, ultimately it's
        just an argument, like passed_vals.  I guess it's easy to remember
        passed_vals as just the arguments and understand how they work,
        while that sub_tracks stuff was confusing.
      . Maybe it's just the presence of sub_tracks in Context?  How can
        I get that out?
    . That 'collect' arg in Eval.eval_expr.  Why False for Eval.reapply
      but other functions make the caller decide?
  - pitch transpose
    . It's confusing how sometimes the environ is applied to the pitch during
      derivation (e.g. Post.set_instrument), and sometimes it waits for Convert
      to do it.  Do I really need both?
      . The environ goes in the Score.Event, which is then applied to the pitch.
        So Post.set_instrument actually maybe doesn't work, if the event
        still has environ.  I have to replace the event environ instead.
    . Post.set_instrument needs to set because I need the environ from the new
      inst.  Could I instead overlay the environ into the event environ?
    . It's error prone because there's nothing that enforces that you set
      instrument with Post.set_instrument, and if you don't, it will work until
      you use a scale with e.g. tuning, and then it will be slightly off.
    - Maybe I should at least not export Score.Event(..) so I can't directly
      modify its fields?
    . Or maybe insist on rederive instead of just changing the instrument.
      In general that's the proper approach.
    . Originally added in the patch 'add interpolate scale':
      The bigger problem was that since pitches got the Environ at conversion
      time, the interpolate scale couldn't substitute `key-from` and `key-to`
      because any environ values it set before evaluating the pitch wouldn't
      "stick".

      So I switched to applying the environ when the pitch is created, but this
      broke the case that made me switch to applying environ at the end in the
      first place, which is when switching instruments in a postproc I want the
      new instrument's environ, specifically Environ.tuning, to apply to the new
      event's pitches.  So now when I switch instruments I have to explicitly
      apply the environ from the new instrument, via Post.set_instrument.
    . Also error prone: I applied octave transpositions via Call.add_constant,
      but then realize-ngoret uses transposed nn to infer, and untransposed
      pitch for the final pitch, so I get a confusingly wrong result.  The
      solution is to apply via Pitches.transpose, but I shouldn't have to make
      complicated decisions like that.
  - It seems I get slicing on an already sliced track if I have an
    intermediate empty note track, e.g.:
      [(">", [(0, 1, "")]), ("> | +a", []), ("*", [(0, 0, "4c")])]
    . Is it a problem?  Should I skip if already sliced?  Document if it's ok.
  - use Data.Vector.Algorithms.Search.binarySearch instead of my own, but
    make sure it has the right specializations.
    . Or at least use mine in Util.Vector.
  / BaseTypes.CallId should have a name more reminiscent of Symbol.
    CallSymbol?
  - Modification of State is still kind of messy since I have lens and
    non-lens versions.  And if I wanted to modify with a lens I wouldn't be
    able to add an effect, like causing damage.  If I used ekmett lenses maybe
    I could unify effectful modification.  I'd also need a way to focus
    on UI state.
    . For example, I can add an allocation with State.allocations, but if
      I wanted to make that cause damage I couldn't.  Of course maybe it
      doesn't matter since I infer damage based on config changes.
    . Also I can't make sure that UiConfig.allocate is used instead of
      directly modifying the map.  The root of the problem is that I have
      unrestricted modification via State.modify_config, but even if I removed
      that I'd want something as convenient as lenses, but with the posibility
      of effects, or at least access to Ui.State and Cmd.State.
    . That said, I'm not sure how much this actually matters.  Maybe I should
      wait to see if it's actually a problem before worrying about it.
    . I guess it already has been a bit of a problem, in that the test had
      a bug where it put on the wrong backend.
    - If State.allocations is so read-only, why not make it a plain function?
      . Tests use it to write...
  - Why re-export UiConfig from Ui.State?  Why not directly reference
    UiConfig?
  - Can I make prev val or {Note,Control,Pitch}Deriver return values more
    typesafe with GADTs?
    . Study https://github.com/goldfirere/glambda for ideas.
  See about removing type prefix from record fields.
    . However, if there are lenses, then I need those names for the lenses.
      But perhaps the plain version can have a leading _?
    . Another bonus of the leading _ is I don't have to worry about unused
      function warnings.
    - Cmd.State
    - Derive.Deriver.Monad
    - Ui.State
    - Ui.UiConfig
    - Perform.Midi.Instrument
  - Util.TimeVector has a hack where a sample at <=0 is considered to extend
    to -inf.  It's because I want a control track call at 0 to extend back.
    But I could do that directly with a postproc ala the tempo hack.  It seems
    like a hack at a higher level is better than one deep in the signal
    implementation.
  - Expr is NonEmpty since there is always at least a "" call, but this is a
    special feature of events.  Would it make more sense to parse "" as [],
    and then special case [] in EvalTrack.derive_event?
    . But I'd need a newtype, otherwise ShowVal [Call] overlaps.  Of course
      the only reason it doesn't already overlap is that a don't have
      a ShowVal for NonEmpty.
    . But Quoted is also Expr... should it be non-empty?
    . I now don't remember where it was that I had an Expr that made sense as
      [], so maybe I don't care about this anymore?
  - Move Derive.info_prev_val to the environ, maintained by EvalTrack.
    . This gets rid of all the Taggable stuff, at the cost of making
      Args.prev_val in Deriver and dynamically typed.
    . There's no Val for Score.Event, so I can't use it for note tracks.
      Of course I could just add one, maybe not a big deal.
  - Overlap detection in Derive.Slice I think is still messed up, or at the
    least it's more complicated than it should be.
  - I could make the fltk interface clearer by putting c_interface.cc into
    fltk, and then putting all the types it depends on in one header.
    . I could make that a .c file too, and get rid of the sketchy hsc2hs on
      c++, as well as clang's "treating 'c' input as 'c++' when in C++ mode"
  - split up CallInfo depending on type
    I got started but was discouraged when it came time to write
    GetLastSample, maybe I should make another go.
    Note tracks can't get a GetLastSample at all.

performance:
  - Reduce memory used by REPL.
    . About 200mb.
    . GHC reads interfaces maybe with ghc/compiler/utils/Binary.hs:/readBinMem
    Try -fignore-interface-pragmas
      . From ghci: 210mb without vs. 1552mb with
      . But from REPL seems to make no difference.
      . Actually, I can't reproduce this now.
    . 200mb for an empty score seems excessive.  Where does it go?
      . With inst db: 197, without sysex: 190, without vsl: 187.4
      . Without repl: 12mb
      . So 190mb consumed just by loading .o files!  du on obj dir is just 76mb.

          . bypecode compile for last two modules
    . 'du -hc build/opt/**/*.hs.o | tail -1' shows 55mb for object code,
      and 19mb for .hi.  I'd think object code would be loaded directly with
      little overhead, but that means .hi code expands by (190 - 55) / 19 = 7x
      expansion, which seems like a lot.
    . Also the memory measurements are haskell heap, which might not include
      loaded object files.
    . However, it's also loading .hi files for external packages too, though
      I'm not sure how much.  The external package code is shared libraries,
      which is shared with the app (and not in the haskell heap anyway).
    . Use dtrace to figure out exactly what the GHC API is loading and when.
    - I should be able to share object code by linking everything as a shared
      library... that might save 55mb at least?
  - Allocation when idle: about 300kb/sec
    . What triggers this?  Nothing, it's basically always happening.
      No, the allocation is always happening, but usually it doesn't get
      retained.
    ? Who is running?
      . Threads:
        / main - Ui.event_loop - should be blocked in Fl::wait,
          though it comes back on every cursor move.  But still allocates even
          when it doesn't have focus.
        . responder - Respond.responder - Should be blocked in STM.atomically
          block.
        / Midi.CoreMidi.initialize forkOS - goes into CFRunLoopRun
        / interpreter
        / Responder accept repl socket
        . Cmd.Performance: eval performance
        . Cmd.PlayC.play - updates the playback
        . Perform.Midi.Play render midi
      . Could it be EKG?
    . It stops during play.
    . Try disabling ekg and use LDebug.memory and see if it's still there.
    . It still grows without ekg.  Well, the second time it seems like it
      moves but doesn't grow.
    . Is there some way to instrument allocation so I can see which thread is
      doing it?
    . Actually it seems like ghci does it all by itself.  So it's either
      inherent to the GHC API or ghc runtime in general.
    . Does it grow with the repl off?  Yes, so apparently not the repl.
  - Control input lag, debug with Trace.traceEventIO
    . http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2012/10/future-work-warp
    . Can I use custom events to see lags in threadscope?
      . Yes, but hard to visualize with everything there.
        I can get labels with View -> Event labels, but often they are jammed
        together, and draw inconsistently.
      . What do the numbers in threadscope's green bars mean?  ThreadId?
      . What I want is for each respond cycle to see where pauses were, and
        why.  I'd want to bracket the respond cycle outside of waiting for the
        next msg, get the total duration of each one.  Possibly I can do that
        by using ghc-events to process the eventlog.
    - GHC's +RTS -v flag is documented but doesn't exist.
      It only exists when -debug, but this isn't documented.
  - Criterion testing: why is cmd_derive faster than derive?  It should be
    doing more work!
  - Check out score size with 'weigh', ala https://github.com/haskell-perf
  - experiment with GC flags
    memory usage:
      . 200 mb -> 350 rss
      . 250 by LDebug.memory and ekg, 500mb by system viewer.
      . I think I have a very large proportion of static data in the GHC API
        loaded .hi files, so that should avoid GC as much as possible.
        Increase the generation count?
        . In the future can I put that in static memory regions?
      . Then I have a lot of short lived garbage generated on each derivation.
      . Then the rest is medium life: score data, Performances.
    . -A8m - larger generation 0 means fewer collections, good if lots of
      garbage is generated.
    . H - Suggested heap size.  I don't really understand this.
    . -qg - turn off parallel gc
    . -n2m - divide -A into chunks, so the first thread to run out doesn't
      trigger a GC for all of them.  Good for unbalanced allocation?
    . -I0 to turn off idle GC.  But it's designed to be good for interactive
      use, and maybe I do pause for >.3s.  Or turn it up to 1sec?
  - find space leaks with nmitchell's stack limit technique:
    . run build/profile/verify_performance +RTS -K975K -xc -RTS --mode=Profile
        p/cerucuk-punyah.state
      Derive.LEvent.events_of,
      called from Derive.Stream.zip3_on.\,
      called from Derive.Stream.emap,
      called from Derive.Stream.zip3_on,
    . Also, what's with the compile_library stuff in the middle?  Should
      I make it stricter?
    . Giving up for the moment since I don't understand the output.
  . Seq.sort_on winds up calling compare on Stack 13374153 times! 9.1% time
    I have to sort it because the stack is kept in reverse order.
    - Per-track stuff can wind up happening zillions of times due to
      inversion, so look for other places where I do work or collect data
      on every track fragment.
    - At least at one point, keeping EnvKey.seed up to date was expensive, and
      it's not even needed when there's no randomization.
    - I could analyze TrackWarp or TrackDynamic to get stats on how many times
      each block is called, along with overall stats on how many notes.  Just
      an interesting thing to know.
  criterion
    - score from a file
    - parsing
  understand deriver performance
    . I never know if changes I am making help or hurt performance, because I
      don't trust any of my profiles.  This means I hardly ever run them, at
      which point why bother having them?

    . Productivity is actually really good during derivation: 70-80%.  Only if
      I turn on heap profiling does it go down to 33%.  So maybe there's
      nothing to do?  Still, it seems like it's slower than it should be.

    . I want to find out how much list copying happens due to Stream being
      a list.  Perhaps I can use SCC annotations?  For transforms, I want to
      see the effect of a transform copying the whole stream so I can tell if
      making it interleave has an effect.
      . It would be nice to see how many times each cons is copied, but it
        would have to be for the output stream specifically.  How can I do
        that?  I think I would have to make my own list type, then count
        allocated cells?
    . Also, from heap profiling, the vast majority is PINNED, which is
      presumably ByteString.  But what is it then, if I'm using Text for
      events now?

  research using pipes for generators and transformers
    . This would handle the composed transforms thing.
    . What about parallelization?
    . What about the MergeList idea?
    . The bigger question is how do I do dynamic state when all the different
      calls are interleaved?
    . Actually now I'm thinking pipes aren't suitable for this.  Pipes are
      about interleaving effects, but derivation is pure.  But not quite,
      since it does depend on StateT.  In a pipes implementation, a generator
      would be 'P.Producer Event Deriver ()', and a transformer would take
      a Producer to another Producer.  Actually, since calls need to typecheck
      etc., it winds up being:
        type Events = Producer Event Deriver ()
        type Generator = Deriver Events
        type Transformer = Deriver (Events -> Events)
      . In a pure environment, pipes still give a constant bound on how many
        elements I hold on to at a time.  But since I look ahead arbitrarily
        much, maybe I don't want that.
    - Set up a pipeline over a StateT that returns Event.
    . The way to do this without pipes would be for transformer to be
      Deriver (Stream -> Stream).  Then I can run all the transformers, and
      then compose all their functions.  At that point, the only thing pipes
      would really give me is a clear picture of how many elements I need
      because each one needs to be specifically awaited... but it seems like
      the look-ahead stuff would be really inconvenient.  And I do the same
      thing, it's just less convenient with pipes.
      . It does mean I have to express all transformers purely.  This is true
        for the non-monadic Post functions, but it means I can't express ones
        where a previous monadic effect on a previous element effects a later
        one.  But that only applies to Threaded, and I can get that anyway by
        threading myself, so maybe there's no problem?
      . The way to prove that would be to remove the monadic Post.emap
        functions.
  make composed transforms more efficient
    . Composed transforms have to keep the whole event stream in memory since
      they can't interleave.
    . Would it then be possible to deforest the intermediate lists?  Bulit-in
      deforestation won't work because of the intervening call machinery, but
      maybe I can recreate it manually.
    - First, figure out how to measure the amount of memory used by
      intermediate lists.  It might be completely trivial.
    - First, I have to detach threaded state for the actual map.  This is
      possible because I don't care about Threaded or Collect.  So modify
      Post.emap_m to map a Derive.run over every element.  Then I need to
      collect the output and turn Left into a Log... or leave it in the stream
      somehow so I can throw at the end.
    - I think the stream will then remain lazy, and I should be able to GC
      as it goes, but verify with Debug.trace.
  - I'd like to see if directly modifying Collect or a MergeList for LEvents
    could reduce garbage, so I need to get some profiling up first.
    . monad-par-extras Control.Monad.Par.AList is deprecated due to poor
      performance, what's up with that?
  - Internal.merge_collect is constantly merging in mempty, try reducing its
    use.  Can I continue to enforce monoid-nature?
  - I should be able to move samples only when converting to MIDI, this way
    I don't need to move parts of the signal that wind up being trimmed.
    Either try to trim the signal earlier again, or delay transformation to
    Perform.
  - https://github.com/tobami/codespeed can make a web page with perf graphs
  . Signal.sig_op has 4.8% alloc, from Control.cotrol_call ->
    Derive.with_relative_control -> Perform.sig_multiply
    . So default multiplication for dyn is expensive.
  scrolling through giant blocks is slow
    - drawing is stil slow, I'll have to look at the fltk layer
      It happens when the block is wide.  Use test_block to see if it's just
      fltk.
      . It's fltk.  Not alpha draw though.
      Scrolling is weirdly chunky near the top when fl_scroll() is on.
      Curiously it doesn't seem to help at all.
    - Would it be faster to call fl_scroll once for all the tracks?  I could
      also theoretically call find_events all at once too, though that
      shows up low on the profile, so maybe it's not a big deal.
    . The thing is, it seems like fl_scroll doesn't actually help scrolling
      speed at all.  Maybe all the time is spent elsewhere?
  - Store signal chunks in the Ui.Track so they can be directly emitted.
    This is only useful for large chunks of 'set' calls, probably recorded
    from MIDI.  So it's probably not pressing until that feature exists.
    . make Ui.Events into 'Map ScoreTime (Event | Chunk Signal)'
    . collapse chunks of adjacent 'set' calls into a Chunk
    . track_derive on a Chunk just returns the contents
    . fltk event render should detect too dense events and omit them, rely
      on the signal render
    . UI edits should see the Chunk expanded out as Events.  Inserting an
      event should modify the chunk or split it depending on if the inserted
      event is a set call or not.
  Cmd
    - If a msg aborts or doesn't run any cmds, don't bother to run diff.
      Except that hardly ever happens if I do shortcut thru.
    - cache track cmds for each track, update when the track title or skeleton
      changes
  Derive
    - parallelize derivation
    AppendList / MergeList for Derive.Stream
      - switch to AppendList and try to get garbage down
        Avoid copying sublists returned by block calls and cache hits
      - see if a Merge constructor can reduce copying
      - can I cache length and range in AppendList?  does it matter?
      - insert parallelism?  maybe the evaluator can do that when it sees
        Merge?
    - lazy signals
      - check out 'at' and 'bsearch' occurrances and see if they can use tails
      - There are lots of lookups in the tempo map
    - see if making a version of Derive.local that's non-monadic in the
      modifier has any effect on performance
    derive cache:
      - can I cache long blocks by slicing them if they're >n?
      - c_block should only cache if the block has > a certain number of
        events.
      - I won't rederive cached generators if they have control damage outside
        of the event range.  But there's nothing stopping a generator from
        reading ahead or behind... come up with some kind of solution for this.
    - fair amount of garbage generated by SignalBase.bsearch_above, I think
      this is because it has to box the values when it pulls them out.  But
      it's really just comparing to a Double, so I should be able to do the
      operation unboxed.  But decide about lazy signals before going nuts on
      this.  If I revert to linear search then none of this is necessary.
    - at_linear is called a lot by compose, by compose_warp, by d_warp
      can I make this more efficient?

fltk:
  - FloatingInput on linux doesn't interact well with a tiling window manager.
    The new window probably needs to be marked transient.
    . Can fltk even do this?  I can't even figure out what xprop should show
      for transient windows.
  - Factoring a bit of score into a call makes it less readable because
    I can't see the events inside.
    . I could put a mini version in the background of the event.  I'd need
      to be careful to retain readability.  Maybe only show the frist track,
      or the first note track.
  - reduce duplication in EventTrack.cc drawable_pixels
  - I need to differentiate DEBUG from LOG.  And LOG can go to seq.log.
    . I'd need to pass a haskell callback.  Worth it?
  - negative event text is pushed downwards the more it wraps
    . Probably that padding pixel making it not line up.
    . All these padding tweaks are a real mess.  Can I get rid of them and
      apply them all in one spot?
  - event "a`tamil-i``xie`" clipping with next event is wrong
  - what's going on with SeqScrollbar and FlSeqScrollbar?  Looks incomplete?
    . It still might be useful to put the top level ruler labels, or cues if
      I ever use those, but I'd have to make it wider.
  - Do I want to support set_ruler for Scrollbar?
  - Drag on an event track title doesn't work, because the new FloatingInput
    doesn't realize that a drag has started.
    . Explicitly sending it FL_PUSH doesn't seem to work, but maybe
      something similar could?
  - It gets a few extra focus/unfocus pairs before show, why?
    . I hacked around with FloatingInput::ready.
  - Also, it seems resize on a window which is a child of another window
    goes into endless recursion.  What is a child window supposed to mean
    anyway?
  - Manually fiddling with track widths is annoying.  It seems like I could
    ask the UI about text extents to resize them automatically.
  - I never wound up using rank > 1, so presumably I could simplify things by
    calling it 'bool align_right' or something.
    . I'm using EventTrack::Align, but the haskell side is still sending
      ranks.
  - When multiple marks from different marklists are in the same place, their
    text collides.  The one from the first marklist should take precedence,
    as should its line.  This is visible when I add logical range markers.
  ? There's an extra axis of information in the width of the event body.  How
    could I use that?
  - add edit and windows menu to all apps
    There must be special OS X support for these
    Apparently not?  iTerms is defined in English.lproj/MainMenu.xib
    https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/WinPanel/Tasks/UsingWindowsMenu.html
    But it doesn't say how to add the Window menu.
  drawing artifacts on retina:
    . Some of this may be fltk bugs.
    - tops of tracks and the tops of track text boxes still get gunk, visible
      when scrolling horizontally
  - bug: There's a focus bug, but I'm not sure how to reproduce it.
    . The focus bug is still here.  Even clicking on the "unfocused" block
      doesn't fix it.  Don't all msgs contain focus?  What can I log after the
      fact to figure out what's going on?
    . Actually this makes me think it's actually in MsgCollector.
      In that case it would be Fl::focus() which is wrong.  Is there a way to
      just ask the OS what window has focus?
    . Cmd.state_debug_ui_msgs doesn't help because I have to take off focus to
      turn it on.  I would need a key stroke that does that.
  - I could set certain Symbols to stretch to the length of their event, this
    would yield a nicer looking score.  But it would mess up the bounds
    detection.
    + gmail: subject:(scaling text)
      But it's OSX only.
  - figure out how to have a minimal title bar in os x (win.border(0) removes
    it altogether)
    I can set something like kUtilityWindowClass in Fl_mac.cxx:Fl_X::make, but
    it doesn't get any kbd input
    . can I get fltk to omit the jellybean buttons on the window?
      . Yes, but requires hacking fltk.
      . Completely disables resizing.  Apparently this is hardcoded.
  incremental redraw / scrolling
    . I don't like the current situation of incremental redraw and scrolling.
      It's also buggy, i.e. one pixel difference between scroll and redraw.
      Get rid of damage and redraw everything every time.  Then I have to make
      it fast to fetch the data for one screenful.  What makes that slow
      currently?
    . Entirely turned it off, speed seems acceptable.
  Track
    - dividers can have separate color for upper part, for collapsable tracks
  + Disable application persistence for fltk apps:

    Can then re-enable ~/Library/Saved Application State.
    . Did the objc call, but doesn't seem to have any effect.

  control track, render signal
    - render option: solid with color gradient
    - combine multiple signals, e.g. one controls xpos, one controls color
      I could combine pitch and dyn.  This is appropriate for the note track.
      . I'm pretty sure OS X can do this, as can cairo, so I would need to
        figure out how to get direct access to that API.  I could get rid of
        the awful alpha_draw.cc hack while I'm at it.
      . Or perhaps I should just switch to OpenGL?

logview:
  - use Fl_Help_View and HTML to display text
  + Logview got some kind of file locked error, presumably trying to track
    a rotated log.
    . It happens if the write handle is still open, for some reason
      Posix.getFileStatus then gets openFile: resource busy (file is locked)
    . But I also got:
      . logview: ./log/seq.log: openFile: resource busy (file is locked)
      . Apparently not caused by log rotation.  Maybe if it checks for
        rotation at the same time a new line is written?
  - can I get the standard edit menu and copy/paste?
  - tabs are not lining up properly
  - option to wrap lines or not?
  - hide or display various attrs: date, file, function, ...

Ui:
  Track
    dense sampled signals
      . efficient storage, preferably as a Signal so no conversion is necessary
      . display dense signals: omit text and trigger lines when zoomed out

test: testing:
  - Write a test for Ui.Diff and Ui.Sync.
    . I think the easiest way to do this is make BlockCStub record its calls,
      then have a UI simulation that interprets those.  Then I can use
      quickcheck to verify a bunch of starting and ending states.  It would
      compare the incremental output against creating the visible UI from
      scratch.
    . It seems non-trivial... but maybe worth it, seeing how complicated
      diff and sync are.
    . If I make Fltk into a typeclass I could substitute a pure State version.
      But I still can't get rid of FltkStub, because the main point is to not
      link in C++.  So as long as I'm doing that anyway, maybe I don't even
      need a typeclass, but I still have to replace the PtrMap functions so
      I don't need MonadIO.
    . Except BlockC uses IO in PtrMap.modify... but that's in BlockC, which
      relies on Fltk (IO a).  BlockCStub wouldn't need that.  So unstubbed
      Fltk is in MonadIO, stubbed one isn't.
    . But how am I supposed to record calls to BlockC without reifying the API
      into a type?  And if I do that, I don't need to do this at all, just
      have Sync return that type.
    . I guess I'm not too worried that an intervening data type will hurt
      performance.  Mostly because just one more allocation is probably not a
      big deal, but also maybe if I inline the interpretation function then
      the allocation goes away.
  * Some way to associate a custom pretty-printer with test input or output,
    e.g.:
      annotate :: (Eq a, Show a) => (a -> Text) -> (a -> a) -> a -> a -> IO Bool
      annotate format f input expected
          | output == expected = equal input output
          | otherwise = do
              equal input output
              putStrLn "input:" >> putStrLn (format input)
              putStrLn "ouput:" >> putStrLn (format output)
              putStrLn "expected:" >> putStrLn (format expected)
              return False
          where output = f input
      ...
      let equal = annotate draw Module.function
    . It feels bogus to duplicate the (==) comparison.  Maybe have an
      parameterized version of 'equal'?
    . Use this with Events.draw_events, it should be useful for all event
      triplets.
  - delete build/test/tmp on every test run to avoid test contamination
    . test/run_tests will clear it out, but sometimes I run them directly
    . But this is pretty much limited to expecting a file in a certain
      place, which pretty much only Perform.Im.Convert does.  Tests that
      create tmp files should use Testing.unique_tmp_dir.
  complete quickcheck derive testing
    I switched back to Double for RealTime, but this means the roundoff errors
    are back.  Use quickcheck to repro them.
    + make a simple deriver that creates event and midi output skeletons
    - integrate quickcheck with generate_run_tests.py
    - assert that the reduced deriver output equals the simple deriver output
    - basic pitches: If the score was created with notes aligned to note
      starts, then every NoteOn should have the appropriate key, there should
      be no pitch bends, and "same note" should be the only reason for
      a channel split
    - basic controls: Given randomly placed control events, notes have the
      correct control curves.  Don't worry about times or midi.
    - slicing: Given some simple note transformers (tuple, place, ...),
      pitches and controls are still associated with the right notes as above.
      Don't worry about times, just that the right notes and the right
      controls.
    - block call property: a couple levels of nesting for block calls, notes
      still have the expected pitches and controls as above
    - inversion: as 'basic pitches' and 'basic controls', but controls are
      below the note tracks, results should be the same
    - stack: generate nested events, check that stack is as expected
  - count number of tests in addition to checks within each test

midi record:
  - implement
  . Ideas for editing recorded MIDI:
    . control: realign attacks, smooth or sharpen attacks.
    . pitch: retune intervals, fix wrong note or add notes, change portamento
      speed.  Add, widen, or narrow vibrato.

REPL: repl:
  - Now that save file is a poll instead of being pushed, it takes a return
    to notice a change.  Can I restore the notification thing?  Or maybe it's
    enough to make sure I write the history to the new name?
  - I don't really use ReplStub, can I get rid of the awkward #ifdef then?
  - only write history when the cmd succeeded
  - command to open the haddock for a module
  - is Cmd.Lang.Fast now obsolete?
  - can I get local variable bindings (let x = ...; y <- ...) to work in the
    REPL?
  - :compile cmd that turns on compilation for everything except Environ
  - :browse to look in modules... can I use GHC.getBindings for this?
  - :module cmd to move evaluation context to a certain module, maybe I
    could also get rid of the need for Cmd.Lang.Environ to import everything.

Cmd:
  Repl:
    - LNote.sort_on_pitch is still not right.
      . With multiple chords I get stacked up extra tracks.
      . Turns out this seems really complicated.  Do I really care that much?
  - Paste between blocks with different track layout is awkward.  Can I have
    a note-oriented paste that reuses or creates the track structure?
  - ModifyNotes doesn't seem to understand about parent note tracks.
  - Interpret a midi file with keyswitches back to the attrs.
    . This is so I can load VSL examples and learn from them.
    . Should it be a score transformation, or start from the parsed MIDI?
    . MIDI seems easier because it's already in a linear format, while for
      the score I'd have to interpret it into one.
    . But then I need to pass the instrument mapping to Midi.load.
    . Maybe not really worth it?  For learning I can load in reaper and just
      watch the VSL UI.
    . But still worth keeping existing work, because I'll need something like
      that for MIDI record.
  - Figure out exactly what bad things could happen because of the
    Ui.fltk_event_loop race.  Also figure out what kind of cancelling I'd need
    to fix them.
  + Write a fancy tile like ViewConfig.horizontal_tile but guesses if you mean
    to tile vertically.
  - Create tempo by "stretching", i.e. select start and end, and create tempo
    mark that will cause the start point to be played where the end point used
    to be played.
  - give Cmd.ModifyEvents.Track the ability to change the track title?
    Cmd.Repl.LPitch.change_scale and to_relative could use this.
  meter / timestep
    - timestep 64*2 skips two 's', because 's' is the minimum match
      skip should be ignored when the match is a larger rank than exists, or
      maybe step should fail.

  ruler:
    - meter type and the construction functions should be integrated more
      tightly
    - LRuler.inject, opposite of extract, replaces sub-block rulers
  Cmd.Edit
    - Make Edit.cmd_invert_orientation set orientation based on the first
      selected event, so I can easily set all to the same.
    - alternate finale-like note entry: hold down step key to set step and
      turn on edit mode, but only while the key is down
      (merge will clip them to the next event)
  copy / paste / Clip
    - clip block should use the ruler, just to make it easier to look at
    - clip could also copy over the skeleton
      It could use it to make sure the paste is compatible, but that might
      be more of an annoyance than a convenience.

  Undo:
    - shift [ and ] undo and redo zooms.  or one key to toggle last zoom?
      . record view changes, at least zoom / scroll so it can be undone
        and redone separately
    - Suppressed undo for val edit is surprising since I tend to do a lot of
      edits without leaving val edit.  Maybe don't do it for pitch val edit.
      Try going back to using the name to suppress, but ignore cmds with no
      name.
    - Add a "revert within selection" that searches backward for the last
      change within the selection.
    - Along those lines, should each block have its own independent history?
      This is supported naturally by the git layout since each block has its own
      file.  Wait, actually it's track, and that would be awkward if I undo one
      block and it changes tracks on another.  How do a say what position
      a block is in the history in that case?
      . One appealing thing is that I don't necessarily want things like config
        changes to be included in undo.
    - Visual display of undo history, because stepping back one-by-one is
      a bit of a hassle.

Derive:
  - A block with logical range called at time 0 gets messed up.
  - Add time offset to TimeVector
    . event_transformed_controls etc. are really annoying.  I can get rid of
      them by building the translation into Perform.Signal.
    . The downside is that every signal gets an offset, even though it's
      just for Score.Event ones, and their offset is all the same.  But still,
      what's another Double in signal full of them?
    . However, Warps also have it, so I could take that field out of the Warp.
    . I'd want to add an X offset to TimeVector.Boxed and Unboxed, but those
      are type aliases so they work with the Vector.Generic functions.
      So how can I resue Vector.Generic?
    . Presumably I could put my new types in the Generic.Vector class too, but
      that might actually be wrong since then they would ignore the offset.
      So maybe I just stop directly using the generic functions.
    . I also want to consider that I may want to have a TimeVector Val to
      replace the Environ.  So it would be nice to eliminate the duplication
      between PSignal and Signal.  Presumably I could do that by putting them
      in a 'class ToVector a where to_vector :: a -> TimeVector.Offset ?',
      then I can either re-export the shared ones directly, or specialize the
      type.
    . I could make an Offset wrapper and have all the TimeVector functions
      apply the offset.  But it seems like a lot of work for what is really
      just a way to fuse multiple translations for just Score.Events.  It's
      only worth it if I do multiple translations before unpacking.
    . I could put just the event controls into Offset, and require a translate
      to get the control out.  This would be like event_untransformed_controls
      except put it in the type.
  sekaran
    How to apply sekaran?
      . >hang -> sekar abab -> notes
      . I want to change the pattern, so the problem is how to set an env
        var for a range on one track?
      . I can add a 'sekar-pattern = abc', but I need to repeat it whenever
        there is a gap.
  fancier randomization
    . How much a note differs depends on its neighbors, so it's not an even
      distribution.  Use brownian noise, or a fractal subdivision scheme.  But
      it's also constrained in how far it can wander from the base value.
      Regardless, I think this means I need history, so it can't be
      a stateless control function.
    . Divide on instrument and hand, so each part gets its own individuality.
    - randomization should be centered on a value, with variance as a signal,
      so I can turn accuracy up or down.
    - Randomness could have some hysteresis, so I can e.g. reduce omit chance,
      but not get isolated notes.  At the extreme setting, it means it turns
      on in a slightly random spot, but stays on after that.
      . Is there a simpler way to get this effect?
  tracklang: TrackLang:
    - Keyword args.
      . A problem with environ defaulted args is that if I do e.g.
        'merge=add | a=b | block', then all of 'block' will have merge=add.
        There's no way to set it just for 'a=b'.  So they're not necessarily
        a great substitute for keyword args.  Also keyword args should
        complain if you give one it doesn't understand.
      . I think a=b syntax is available, but do I want to make a Val out of it?
        It would be resolved by Derive.Sig, and not actually make it to calls,
        but Quoted is like that too.
      . And realistically it seems really invasive to support a=b if it's not
        a Val.  But I wind up with weird things like a=b=c.
    generalize sub-event calls
      - Generalize sub-event calls so that they can also take block names.  This
        is just another way to write sub-tracks, perhaps more convenient if
        I want them to be independent.
      - Also generalize them so if I put it as a transformer in a track title,
        the track is treated like a sub-event call.  This way I can apply a
        transformation to the whole track without needing to wrap it with an
        event.  Paired with the Sub.modify_notes macro feature, I can have
        a track with its own little language, e.g. pakhawaj bols.
        . Could do this by making 'ctx_sub_tracks' available in the track title
          call.
        . I think there were calls in Prelude.Lily that would be interested in
          a more defined distinction between track and note level transformers.
      - Could also do a block-level thing.
    - Perhaps I should have a separation between "" as called by Util.note by
      other calls, and "" as called from the track.  The problem is that it
      applies Flags.can_cancel at TrackTime 0, which is only appropriate for
      a direct call from the track.  This is the reason for
      Gangsa.realize_notes.remove.
      . Flags.can_cancel is now obsolete, but maybe the issue still stands?
    - I was confused because I wrote '%just-base = (nn (c3))' instead of
      '%just-base = (hz (nn c3))'.  Can I use type tags to catch that sort of
      thing?
      . Hz doesn't have its own type, so it winds up being Untyped.  But any
        type can coerce to Untyped, so it can't complain if you passed NN.
        I could make Typecheck Double require Untyped, but that would break all
        the stuff that doesn't care about types.
      . Ultimately, this is because pitches take a PitchConfig, which takes
        ControlValMap, which is untyped.  I started a branch making it typed,
        but eventually lost interest since it seemed overly complicated.
    - Rethink if I really want track event calls in TrackTime, rather than
      normalized time.
      . Implementing c_sequence I was confused how stretch was applied twice,
        since Eval.eval_quoted doesn't normalize the event duration.  Same
        problem is in Gamakam2.  It's error prone that you can place the note
        via both Derive.place and via the Derive.info_event.
      . On the other hand, working in TrackTime is convenient, e.g. in gangsa
        norot I can place notes based on the passed-in dur.  If it were
        normalized, I'd have to unwarp back to TrackTime... can I even do that?
      . Details are also in "Derive.EvalTrack".
      . Adding the repeat call was unintuitive because deriver placement is
        unintuitive.
        . Ideally I could just say (0, 2), (2, 2) and it would work.
          Instead, I get (0, 8) and (2, 8)
          This is because the block isn't normalized, so stretch by 2 makes it
          4, then the stretch by 2 for the event goes to 8.
        . This is so that just 'deriver' by itself gets it right.  If I instead
          made deriver always normalized, then the above would work, but
          I would have to do 'Derive.place (Args.start args) (Args.duration
          args) deriver' to avoid it always showing up at 0-1.  And actually,
          I couldn't do that from a transformer, because what about the next
          transformer?  I should instead have each transformer be in
          normalized time.  'repeat' becomes
            [Derive.place start (1/times) | start <- Seq.range_ 0 (1/times)]
        . For blocks, it's actually almost that, except I have to translate
          back by the start time first.  This is because blocks are already
          normalized to the event duration.  I think?
    Typecheck coerces to TypedFunction as a common signal type
      - It turns out this is not so useful because a default TypedFunction
        doesn't have a default control name like a Sig.typed_control does.
        The documentation is also worse.  The way to fix this would be to
        let the default be any coercible type.  But to do that and be type safe
        I'd want a separate class for pairs of types that can definitely be
        converted.
        . Possibly a way around is to include ControlFunction in ControlRef...
          but why do I want so much to pass control functions?  Especially since
          I can already pass a concrete signal as a ControlSignal.
    . It would be nice to be able to have an arg default to ControlRef and
      have typecheck coerce to scalar via Call.control_at.  But once again the
      problem is that I can't coerce to a type different from the default.
    - if I had a boolean type, I could generalize calls in Conditional:
      . when-e key -> when (env key)
        when-e key val -> when (= (env key) val)
      . when-c 1 cont -> when (= %cont 1)
      . if-c< cont 1 a b -> cond (< %cont 1) a b
      . However, they get more wordy, so maybe I don't want it.  E.g. for
        cond I'd actually want a 'switch %cont' and then I need either
        partially applied functions, or just write 'switch<'.
    - replace VAttributes with a general purpose VSet.
      . No users though?
    - there should be a character that triggers a parse failure, which is used
      by invalid ShowVal instances like ShowVal Pitch
    - it's confusing how some calls expect env vals like 'x = 1' and some
      expect controls like '%x = 1'.
      . The obvious way to solve this would be to merge env vals and controls,
        but that's a big change.
    - Track caching is too fragile, if I add a track with scope over everything
      then I get no caching.  Instead I should cache the bottom note track, or
      perhaps every note track.  But that doesn't work because they're all
      sliced up.
  Derive.Sig:
    - Support pairs, e.g. a list of pairs of arguments.
      . many_pairs :: (Typecheck a, Typecheck b) => Text -> Parser [(a, b)]
      . Can I generalize to triplets etc. without a separate function for
        each?  Also, could I reuse many / many1?
      . Can I have a Typecheck instance for (,)?  No, becaues it comes from
        a single Val.
      . I would have to turn Sig into a real parser.
    - Try writing a new Typecheck / Sig which is a real parser.  It can have
      backtracking and nested parsers.
    - if I add an Alternative instance to Sig.Parser I can write arg parsers
      like 'Sig.many xs <|> Sig.many ys'.  I think.  If I wind up with something
      else like Derive.Call.Val.num_or_pitch it would be worth trying out.
      . E.g. Conditional.c_if_c takes: Symbol (Number, Quoted)* Quoted
      . Implement empty as pure (), then (<|>) should try left and if it fails,
        try right.  Doc is (x | y).  'some' and 'many' are like Sig.many1 and
        Sig.many, except they have to backtrack.
      . But derivation may evaluate expressions and check the type after that.
        Do I really want to do that with backtracking?
  postproc
    performance details / humanization
      - irregularize runs based on fingering patterns, e.g. groups of 3
    - retune a note depending on the previous interval (e.g. sloppy pitches
      when playing quickly)

  - consider track calls and block calls:
    note_track :: TrackTree.EventsNode -> Derive.EventDeriver
    derive_tree :: ScoreTime -> TrackTree.EventsTree -> Derive.EventDeriver
    I could use this to implement is-ly and no-ly, and also totally custom
    track types and block types.

  tempo track:
    - Nested tempo tracks at the toplevel block should normalize like they do
      when called.
    - Nested tempo tracks are probably broken for hybrid and absolute tempo.
    - Nested tempo tracks are probably also broken with a logical start.
  note calls:
    - retune call: differences based on speed should be more obvious, so that
      should also be on a curve.
    + chord calls, with automatic dyns for the notes.
      Originally I intended each note to go in its own track, with the idea
      that it takes about the same space but is more powerful and flexible.
      But it's not quite true, because the extra track is there for the whole
      block, though perhaps that's a side-effect of having blocks which are
      too large.  More compellingly, chords can automatically fiddle with dyn
      and start time, and can also interpret chord symbols.
    mridangam:
      - Automatic inference for Ki vs. Mi, e.g. in sarvalaghu.  E.g.
        dxd -> dld, but dxpx -> dkpk.  Also it can change based on speed and
        emphasis.
      - connect kendang, reyong, etc. to 'tir' and 'seq' calls.
      - make india.mridangam seq call align to the end for -0 dur
      . It would be nice to alternate mridangam and kendang tirmanam, e.g.:
        mridangam, kendang, both.  But I'd need to either write the tirmanam
        in solkattu dsl and give it a name, or have a mini solkattu dsl, e.g.
        with syllable breaking:
        . tri-mk 'kitakitataka nakadit_ talang_ talang_ ta' lang_
      . I'd have to have a standard stroke map, but I'm not sure how well that
        would work in practice.
      . reyong: takadinna -> cccc, nakadit -> i12, talang -> +O
        . c = cek, k = kempyung, 0123 -> relative scale degree, .+ -> byut,
          oO -> byong
        . I could also have shift up, shift down annotations, like speed or
          nadai.
      * india.mridangam: 'tri' call with variable karvai, and an error if it
        doesn't line up
        . Maybe 'tri' should be called 'tir' for tirmanam?
      - Perhaps mridangam should automatically transpose the octave to be within
        its range.
        . I can use something like Cmd.Instrument.Bali.wrap
      - tha is too loud... I can compensate by using -, but maybe the scale is
        off.  Velocity should be logical, so if you play all at the same
        velocity it's like the same dynamic for all strokes.
        . Or I could make + be 0.5, and * be full volume.
      - perhaps only pitched notes should change with the tuning?
      sarvalaghu
        - get them from Score or MridangamScore.
        - adjust to the talam
        - subdivide at slower speeds
      solkattu:
        reyong realization:
          - some way to select between melodic and rythmic realization, and
            transposition for melodic
            . This could be the same as the emphasis mechanism, if I extend
              it to attach Attributes.
          * implement n1 etc. calls in bali.reyong.solkattu
        - Emphasis or automatic variant versions of patterns, e.g.
          . kt_kno -> ki_kno.  k_t_kno -> i_i_kno, i _ i _ ktkto _,
            pu_ pu_ ktkto
          . The emphasis note can be i, or pu, or maybe u, or p+u (play like
            kre on pakhawaj).
        - Mridangam patterns can vary by intensity in addition to duration and
          family. How can I represent and realize that?  E.g. the final of
          a group of three can be higher intensity.
          . It can also be a variant pattern, e.g.
            k_kto k_k_kto k_t_k_kto -> repeat 4 k_kto
        + Notate Janahan's version of koraippu_janahan.  If I can get a lot
          of realizations for standard sollus maybe I can start to recognize
          styles and get an automatic system for deriving strokes.
        * bug: formatting messed up with patterns: realizep koraippu_janahan
          . Because I get p7----- when stroke_width=2.
        - Can I put StrokeMap and Patterns together?  Then I can put standard
          strokes along with the stroke map, and override them together.
        * For MridangamDsl, all of the Korvai stuff should be unnecessary
          except Tala, and the whole sollu to stroke mapping is annoying.
          Also it makes ppr output not very useful.  If I generalize Sollu
          out of Solkattu, I can directly replace it with a Stroke and all of
          that goes away.
          . Can I cut down on the types by using this for Realize.Stroke as
            well?  Then I have Alignment... but I want to keep that for
            MridangamDsl as well.
          . I can't generalize Solkattu.Solkattu to replace Sollu because then
            I can't do cancel_karvai.  I can generalize Solkattu.Solkattu's
            Sollu to put a Stroke in there, but then all the Korvai.realize
            stuff does't work and it seems like a pain to redo that.  Instead,
            I just use NoSollu and have pretty not show that, and it's much
            simpler and almost as good.
        - format: if the ruler changes after an avartanam line break, show the
          partial ruler, e.g. Realize_test.test_format_nadai_change
        - I could have an 'elide' annotation.  It deletes the previous notes
          so far as they match the next ones.
          . E.g. tri_ (din.__) p7 . elide . p7.p6.p5
            or: tri_ (din.__3) (ta.__3.ta.ta.ka.din.na)
              . elide . tri_ (din.__2) (ta.ta.ka.din.na.din)
          . To keep if from eliding large repeats, it should stop at the
            shortest match.  But then if it happens to end and start with the
            same sollu it will just drop that single sollu.
        - Notation {take,drop}M functions get matras via duration_of and
          divide, while matras_of counts matras directly.  I'm not totally
          sure what the difference is and which one is correct.
          . With division I can get matras even if nadai changes but it winds
            up being integral.  So nadai 4 -> 8 would be equivalent to a speed
            change, which is good.  But 4 -> 6 will also be valid matras if
            I have a multiple of 3.
        * Notation rdropM and probably rdrop is broken for tempo changes.
        * Realize.format: matra_width should be able to go to 1 for speed > 0.
          I think for this I have Realize.flatten_speed max_speed start at 1,
          but then I have to fix two character strokes like p5.
          . Ruler marks should also move back for an overlapping note.
          . Just have infer_ruler count each note as 1.
        * Realize.format: ruler and emphasis gets messed up when a single
          note spans a beat.  I should first normalize to matras.
        * format could combine rests to avoid k___ type stuff.
        - replacements, e.g. ta.ki.ta -> nang.__ . faster (ki.ta.ta.ka)
          . use this in koraippu_janahan
        / I think I need an absolute SetSpeed, so I can pad a number of
          aksharas, regardless of the speed.
          . I also need it to rest by Duration, or to turn that into matras.
          . At the score level it's most convenient to work with sollu-matras.
            These are relative to nadai, but that's actually good.  With speed
            changes I can get fractional matras, and operations can actually
            work as long as the speeds line up and I don't have to drop
            half of a sollu.
          . However, for things like 'align', I need to know that tala and
            nadai, so I can emit a certain number of aksharas.
          . Actually since align is used at the top level, I can assume s0.
        / speed changes mess up the ruler, e.g.  Score.c_17_04_04 in misra
          . Not any more.  Maybe I just had things messed up?
        * Realize.format: break long lines
        * special Patterns for nakatiku (p4) and tangkita nakatiku (p6)
        * Realize.format: Emit a new ruler if the nadai changes.  I can do it
          by making a ruler for each line and filtering out the repeats.
        * Tala doesn't support chapu talas.
        * remove arudi and nadai from Tala.  I've hardly ever used arudi
          alignment, and not all talams have one.  And nadai can just default
          to 4, as an attribute of the solkattu, not the talam.
        * various take and drop functions should retain the speed
        * Realize.format should be able to fit an adi 4 avartanam on one line.
        - extend Karvai to take a minimum number of Rests before it applies.
          Default to 2, but a chapu might require 3.
        * Why does format make the S2 sequence in
          Realize_test.test_realize_pattern have underscores?
          . S2 (k.__.t.__) should be equivalent to S1 (k.t).
          . It's a hassle to manipulate speeds when there is just S1-4.  If
            I make it just an integer, then I can always go negative.
          . Then I can make speed a relative change, so to slow /2 I can just
            wrap in Speed -1.  Then all the s2 stuff is just up or down.
          . Then the first step in realization is to normalize to the fastest
            speed, where 0 is akshara/nadai.
        * explicit strokes via (!) should not require a valid entry in the
          StrokeMap, so I can have irregular sequences manually, e.g.
          ta_ta.din_din.gin_gin.na_na.thom_thom
          . But I still need ones that are in the StrokeMap to use it because
            of when it's a known sequence, only with one stroke replaced.
            So it if there's no match in the StrokeMap, then use the stroke
            and move on.
          . Of course the other way to do that is just put the exact manual
            sequence in the StrokeMap, but it's a duplication, but minus
            the rests.
        - Apply common variation patterns.
            transformations:
              . karvai u u u -> u i u
              . X X X -> gap X, gap-1 kpX, gap-2 kpnpX
              . X X X -> gap X, gap-2 oktpX, gap-4 ktktoktpX
              . alternate realization for 3rd repeat: 345 345 3333
              . __3 -> __2.p or __2.o if o follows
              . variation for a phrase prefix, usually on its repeat:
                k_k -> kpk, or k_p -> kpt
              . stroke substitution in a transformation, e.g. reduce or expand:
                pk -> kk, e.g. k_kto, k_k_kto, k_t_k_kto.
            . If I can apply them as a postproc, then I can get even random
              variations.
            . Or maybe I should write them explicitly, but make them easier to
              write?
        * dinga can be realized with a light tha, so maybe I need a "light"
          modification?
          . Also need a heavy emphasis.
          . It's attached to sollus, but needs to be propagated to the stroke.
          . Notation can be the same as karvai, e.g. hv k.t.k.
          . Too bad haskell doesn't support prefix operators.
            I could hack it by combining with .: a .^ b = a . light b or
            a ., b for heavy.  But 'v' is the normal heavy, so why not
            a . v b.  Then can I do a letter for light?  h?  Or just hv and lt
            to avoid conflicting with single letter stroke names.
          . Actually this goes on strokes, not sollus, so it would go in
            Patterns or StrokeMap: (ta.ka, [hv t, k]).
        - I use Pretty for format, which is awkward for Realize.Stroke, since
          I can tolerate some ambiguity for the same of a single letter width,
          but Pretty shouldn't have such a restriction.  Add Format class?
          But it still returns Text instead of Char since patterns have two
          characters.
        - This turns into a general way to represent unparsed expressions.
          . Text shouldn't have ShowVal, it should be Symbol, and then CallId
            should have a separate type, its ShowVal doesn't need quotes,
            unless there is a space.
          . Then Unparsed represents parseable text, so actually ShowVal
            should return that.  Is it worth having a separate type over using
            Text, though?
          . I should be able to parse Expr Unparsed without the intervening
            ShowVal by directly parsing the Unparsed vals.
          * Make CallId its own type, so its ShowVal can be correct.
          * Rename Symbol to Str, VSymbol to VStr
          * Rename CallId to Symbol.
          * Update references from BaseTypes.CallId to Expr.CallId
          - Use generic Expr from Derive.Expr.
          - Move BaseTypes.Expr etc. and the above to Derive.Expr where the
            val is abstract, and BaseTypes specializes to Val.
            . ToExpr should actually take Attributes -> a -> Expr.
            . Then I'd want some general purpose fallback for e.g.
              soft -> "^ |", loud -> "v |" if the stroke doesn't have more
              specialized notation.
          . This seems like a big deal, so try to do a hack first where I
            pretend CallId is just a plain Unparsed.
        - Higher level variation, e.g. 666 666 666 -> 555 666 777 or even
          777 777 777 -> 567 876 789.  Actually the latter seems not so
          interesting.
        - Implement PatternFamilies so I can have 6 8 6 7 6 5, or even just
          distinct realizations within a single korvai.
        - Repeat oriented variation, e.g. 3 5 33 5 333 -> 333 5 33 5 3
        speed
          . I can't represent double speed without changing the talam, which
            then makes me write everything with spaces between.
          . I also can't represent a shift from kandam to chatusram.
          . It seems I could solve both by allowing the talam to change in the
            middle of a Sequence.  But I still wonder if changing nadai from
            e.g. 5 to 10 would throw off the talam calculation?  Of course I
            don't actually have a talam calculation beyond where is arudi.
          . But then when does this actually get realized?  If the main use
            now is to display as text, then it needs to go all the way
            through to [MNote], because otherwise I can't display a different
            gati in ascii.
          . Changing nadai is easy to display, just change emphasis groups.
            For speed 2, I think I would want to double the letter density.
            So they are different.
          . At Speed > S1 I can have fractional Matras.  But then I can't make
            RRests for each one, unless rests all have a duration.
          . But it's just the duration that's fractional, Matras themselves
            have variable duration.  I could say that at S2 I just fit *2
            matras in.
          . I think I can get rid of the variable karvai concept, it
            complicates alignment and doesn't seem to be that useful.
            verify_alignment should just be step through notes and complain if
            the count isn't right when I hit any alignment marker.
          . I can get rid of RealizedNotes entirely, and just have
            verify_duration.
          . This means karvai is just another kind of pattern, but I want to
            retain the distunction... or why even do that?
          . Often (always?) you count the stroke along with its duration, so
            d__ is a 3.
        - Should I change mridangam notes to be consistent with Solkattu.Dsl?
          I have to put thoppi on the left, for 'od' instead of the keyword
          'do'.  And I have to change tha to p instead of +.
        . Performance rules for variations, e.g. tk can be played kk.
        . Conditional derivation that depends on position in the tala, e.g.
          thali / khali.
        alternate realization

          - kajar
          * reyong
          - gangsa / marimba
        ? Crazy idea: it might be nice to use underline or double underline
          for faster.  Is there a way I could get the editor to display
          special brackets as underline, and then turn those special brackets
          into a 'faster' call?  I think if I'm doing this, I definitely need
          a preprocessor, though if I keep basic haskell syntax and define it
          as a translation to haskell, then I can keep all the usual features.
          . Alternately, use syntax highlighting.  Sufficiently fancy
            highlighting could highlight 'faster (...)'.  I don't think ascii
            can do double underlines, though it could do italic+underline or
            something.
          . I could also try to automatically align by time.  I imagine
            a sufficiently advanced vim macro could do that, e.g. bind ^tab to
            annotate the current expression with line info, evaluate it, and
            align the current line, or try to move the cursor to the next
            beat.  Maybe not worth it though, since the whole idea of the dsl
            is that time can be abstract.
    pakhawaj bols
      . Score integrate to convert bols to low level calls
        . Actually score integrate doesn't work like that, it just copies the
          input.  It would have to be derive integration.
      . Or maybe just interpret the bols directly, but due to context
        sensitivity they need to be all processed together, not as separate
        calls.
        . In general I don't have a way to interpret a track as a whole.  This
          is the "track call" thing I was thinking about a long time ago.
      - Add an input mode for bols.
    bali:
      - abstract kajar parts, and gong cycles
      - kajar: automatic hand muting as with reyong.
      + add additional legong and wayang tunings.  Probably 'tuning' would be
        the most appropriate, but it's already using for umbang/isep.  Maybe
        saih=umbang/isep?  Or keep tuning the same and use laras?  Kelamin
        would be cheeky but only appropriate to kendang and not even Balinese.
      legong scale:
        - add isep to *legong
        - pick better nns for pemero notes 4 and 7
        - dotted cipher notation should use 4 and 7 instead of 3# and 6#.
      kotekan: gangsa:
        - >gangsa instrument, which is pemade + kantilan
          . It can be a alias of `multiple`:
            gangsa = multiple "(inst=pemade) "(%t-oct=1 | inst=kantilan)
        - nyog polos first can be inferred based on whether it's a major ruler
          division.  But should I?  I can just write 's+' to be explicit.
        - Simplify reyong norot in the same way as gangsa norot.  I also
          want to add the prepare_start feature.
          - Can I remove Once now?
        . The kotekan call can be hard to use for irregular sections like:
          . |       |       |
             3-23-3-23-23-23-5
            2-12-2-12-12-1234-34-4-3
            |       |       |
            -3-23-3-23-23-21-
            2-12-2-12-12-1-10
            |
          . 4-3-4-3-44
            12-212-211
          . Maybe just a literal "once" kotekan call?
            Start at 0.
          . Maybe it's not "once" but "normal alignment", so maybe I can unify
            this with orientation.  But I think I need an explicit Positive
            orientation call like 'ko', rather than using event orientation.
          . For end orientation I still want to align to the end, but can I
            do that just by rotating the kernel?
          . I could say rotate or not based on the leading 'k'.
            (1)-12-1-21
          . Actually, maybe rotation isn't the problem.  Instead I have places
            where the inference rules don't work because the pitch is moving:
                 3-23-21
              (2)-12-1-10
            . Can I infer?  (2)-12-1-10  -> ... not sure
            . Or write both? ke '-12-1-10' '3-23-21-'
            . I can, but it still takes longer than just writing it out.  And
              if it's not pitch-independent, there's not much benefit to the
              specialized kotekan notation.
        - Maybe have a character extend previous note.
        - Another option is to write the polos notes directly, and then
          a parent call that infers sangsih.  This avoids the problem where
          I have to figure out how many little numbers.
          . But if I'm going to do that, why not just use +p, +s, and +k to
            write the whole thing explicitly?
        - in norot -> nyog transition, the last norot note cancels the first
          nyog note.
          . sangsih 6i cancels out the explicit 5e
          . Since {final} cancels normal notes, this is working as intended, and
            I can fix with final=f or 'strong', but it's surprising.  Maybe
            I should only have a final for negative events?
        - make gangsa and reyong norot and noltol dispatch to 'm' instead of
          directly applying +mute.  Or should I have a call for a weak note, and
          leave 'm' for an explicitly muted note?
        - gangsa zero dur mutes too loud
          . Really I need loose and tight mute, but I'll have to do my own
            samples, or maybe add a loose mute as open with just envelope.
        - noltol puts a mute stroke after a final note.
          . It's becasue it has a lower threshold, but not an upper one.
            But really it's not the threshold, but the form, noltol should be
            during kotekan.  So maybe I should really build this into kotekan
            calls.
        - clip should be end-weighted.  If I used a negative duration I could
          make it based on that...
          . Wait, isn't that what Clip is?
        - generate all possible kernels following some playability rules,
          e.g. no more than 2 notes in a row, only one rest
          . I could then use that to automatically select a pattern for
            a given destination, with some constraints like playability from
            the previous pattern (no fast jumps), above vs. below, telu vs.
            empat.
          . Then do that to make a random kotekan for ngubeng and majalan.
        - in Gangsa.realize_kotekan_pattern, pass Nothing as the start to not
          limit the start
        - inst postproc can interpret +mute as either just a mute, or open, or
          in between depending on %mute.
          . Then I don't need a configurable mute for
            Gangsa.gangsa_norot_arrival.
          . Reapply the 'm' call instead, and override that as appropriate.
        - an optional special pattern which switching between kotekan and back,
          e.g. 112-2-2-
      wayang in octaves
        . pemade: >p=>p-umbang | >s=>p-isep
          kantilan: >p=>k-umbang | >s=>k-isep | %t-diatonic=5
        . I could do it with >wayang-both that emits >wayang-p and >wayang-k. Or
          just call the score twice, once with transpose +1 oct.
        . I definitely want two calls because then kantilan randomizes
          differently.
        . Or I could create the kantilan as a integration of the pemade, so it
          can still be modified. I think this would want a "score integration"
          which just copies and merges the events directly, and doesn't do
          the intermediate derivation.
        . I could add inst aliases, e.g. >umbang = >p-umbang, etc.
          Or a note-track call: '>umbang = "(>p-umbang)'
          This can't be done with call aliasing because it's actually
          'note-title >inst', and anyway wouldn't help with 'inst = >x'.
        . The intended way to do this is have > instrument, and then set it in
          the caller.  But then you can't put >1 inst on the same block.
        . But this way doesn't work if I want differences in the kantilan
          version.  I would have to do correspondingly more copy and paste to
          replace the bit I want to change.
        . Ideally I'd like something like integration: everything is
          duplicated with no extra work, but an integration is available to
          edit.  But it would be a kind of "deep integration", where
          I duplicate the entire structure, from score on down.  Score
          integration could theoretically do that.
      trompong: reyong:
        - Damp level is way too high, I have to put %damp=.2 everywhere.
        - remove kilit, isn't it just norot now?
        - A %damp of 0x01 is still counted as 0 due to 7-bit MIDI.  I have to
          have at least 0x02, but this seems like exposing details.
          . One way is to have a postproc ensure ==0 or >=1/127.
          . Or I could do the min thing in the performer for all MIDI.
          . Or maybe this "pick a low number" thing is no good.  I could
            have another control to turn off damping.
            . The sustain pedal, cc64, is a natural choice.
            . But CCs are global, so no good.
        - for infer-damp, also infer damp level
          . Damp gets louder when notes are closer, or faster.
          . Also longer note is a quieter damp, or just say if the length is
            over a threshold don't damp at all.
        - How to configure open and closed damping?  I can currently do it
          by adding +open, but that might be too broad because it also applies
          to +cek.  Or I could always damp closed if that sounds good.
          Or I could infer it based on speed.  Otherwise, I can change the
          attr to +loose-mute or +tight-mute to explicitly configure.
        - split to ngembat
          . There are several ngembat variations:
            . fast:
              5 61    35 61
                 1        1
            . slow:
              561   53561
               21      21
        - kbd entry for /, X, O, + etc.?
        kilitan: norot:
          . How to do norot for real?
            . Each voice is semi-independent, and may have different
              preparation patterns and times.  But then sometimes they
              coordinate.
            . Variations are random, but frequency is controlled by
              "kewayahan".
          variants:
            - controlled by variant control
            - omit notes
            - hardcoded variants, e.g. p1 on dong
            - Delayed note, e.g. on ding, oiioioi
            - Pickup can be iioi style, but parts that don't have the pitch
              often play the normal kilitan, or a passing tone.
          above speed threshold:
            - omit notes
            - Entirely different fast patterns.
          - Also I want to be able to control the dyn.  There should be
            a single control for +mute dyn.  Actually I already have that
            if I multiply %damp, right?  Still, explicit +mute notes and
            kilitan +mute notes are stronger than damping, so I need two
            I think.  Damping should default to a fraction of +mute dyn.
          - write an alternate style of kilitan, e.g. with a 6 note scale in
            tisram
        kotekan
          - support high dung for position 4
      gender:
        - rambat damping emulation: notes ring on by default until they can be
          damped.  Damp at the first opportunity, where opportunity is defined
          as a break with no notes for a certain amount of time.  Can only damp
          two neighboring notes at a time.
  india: gamakam:
    - I think Gamakam4 doesn't test next event pitch, e.g.
      Gamakam3_test.test_sequence on '!!-v-'
    dyn:
      - Add support for '_' and, why not, '.'.
    - '.' call on the note messes up gamakam
    - 'v' for next pitch is wrong when the next pitch isn't on a note start
    - There still seems to be a case where prev pitch is wrong, it has to
      do with a '--' event.
    - And another prev pitch bug:
      [ (">", [(0, 3, ""), (3, 1, "")])
      , ("*", [(0, 0, "2d"), (1, 0, "3s"), (2, 0, "3r"), (4, 0, "3s")])
      , ("*", [(0, 0, "!^20"), (1, 0, "!0="), (4, 0, "!=")])
      ]
      . Last note should get 3r, but instead gets 3s.
    . For the violin, I want to experiment with other controls, e.g. pitch
      slides also do less bow-force, or dyn can reduce bow-force and
      bow-speed.

    - overshoot "curve" for 'smooth': over2 over3, depending how far over
    . instead of hardcoding specific times, I should say short, medium, long,
      which can vary and have some randomization:
      . short, medium, long: -s = "(rnd low high) | -m = .. | -l = ..

  control calls:
    - signal transformations: +, *, max, min
    - saturation limit, e.g. flatten sine wave but without clipping
    - continuous tempo warping for signals
      tempo: "2" -> "1", "2", cont: "2" -> "i, 1", should emit a bent line

  control functions:
    I'm unhappy with control functions in general
      . More details in BaseTypes NOTE [control-function]
      . They duplicate Deriver but can't use it
      . they add another layer on top of controls that you have to take into
        account manually.
      . Also, depending on the pos means the signal is no longer a continuous
        function, and can't be displayed as a line.
      . Making calls all take Call.Function was my attempt to abstract that
        away, but I wound up giving up on that because then the default of an
        optional arg would have to be a Function which is then unshowable.
        To solve this I would have to make a total 'coerce' for Typecheck.
      uses:
        . Randomization, with various ranges and distributions.
        . Some CFs like cf-swing could just be another signal, I only do it as
          a function for efficiency, which is due to my choice to make signals
          fully sampled.
        . A way to pass an interpolation function.  This is a disjoint use
          since it doesn't need any of the BaseTypes.Dynamic state and isn't
          useful as a normal CF.
    - Could use rank to modify dyn and emphasize or de-emphasize notes on
      important beats.
    . With 'real' and 'score' and the signal conversion functions, I gradually
      rewrite more and more functions from Deriver to functions with a
      TrackLang.Dynamic argument.  Also they're going to start to want an
      exception, and why not logging too, and I'm right back to Deriver.
    . Why can't I make ControlFunction into a Deriver?
      ControlFunction moves to Deriver.Monad, so Val must also.
      Now control function stuff must be exported from Deriver, not TrackLang
      and Score.  But also Val can't be exported from TrackLang, and there are
      tons of users for TrackLang.Val.  Maybe I can split TrackLang into a low
      level version.  In fact I already have, everything Deriver uses
      TrackLang for can come from BaseTypes, except Typecheck.  Monad.val_call
      must move to Lib.
      . Environ, Pitch, and Val all move into Derive.  And Score.Event.
        This is getting to be pretty much everything.
      . Another option is to make Derivers polymorphic.  I can put the
        fields in TrackLang.Dynamic in a typeclass.

pitch: scales: scale:
  scales / Derive.Scale:
    - I think the symbolic pitch_note functions should use RelativePitch,
      otherwise the symbolic pitch they produce can't be parsed back in to
      produce the same pitch.
      . Demonstrate with some tests and fix if necessary.
      . For ChromaticScales and JustScales
    - TheoryFormat.make_relative_format is a confusing name because it makes
      a Format from a RelativeFormat.
    - It's confusing how the default_key is built-in to parse_key but also
      passed separately... maybe it should take a flag to say whether an error
      should become the default?
    - Strip type prefixes from Pitch.Pitch and Pitch.Degree?  Add lenses?
    - add ratio transpose signal, that multiplies hz
    support scales that are different ascending vs. descending
      . Scales have two versions of each degree.
      . scale_input_to_note takes a previous Note arg, which it can use to
        guess the appropriate variant.
      . Variants have to have unambiguous names though, maybe 4n^ and 4n_
      . Use scale_alternate to switch a note between alternates, bind to the
        same key as enharmonic.  If there are no enharmonics, then fall back
        on alternate.
    raga:
      - Support arohana and avarohana by treating them as enharmonics
        Is this really a good idea, since they aren't anything like
        enharmonics?  Maybe I should just use the flip-enharmonic key, but
        keep the concept separate.
        . I could keep it at the Cmd level by remembering the last entered
          pitch and defaulting this one based on it, or I could try to put it
          at the Derive level too by having the pitch itself be based on the
          previous one.
        . Putting it at the derive level seems really hard and unreliable, so
          I should have separate symbols, e.g. 4r^ and 4r_ for up and down
          variants.  For western modes this isn't necessary since the notation
          is already absolute.
        . Or I can model r1 r2 r3 as accidentals.  The raga gives the default,
          and then I can change the cycle enharmonics binding to instead cycle
          number of "accidentals" to force a particular one.
        . So I would model as a chromatic scale but with a custom number of
          accidentals per degree:
            s, r1 r2 r3, g1 g2 g3, m1 m2, p, d1 d2 d3, n1 n2 n3

    - letter and jianpu but with implicit accidentals based on the key
  intonation: think about how to do e.g. meantone melody, with just harmony
    . Do a postproc to analyze simultaneous notes.  If I use an attr to
      tag the melody, I can tune everyone else to it.  But how do I retune
      notes with non-trivial pitch curves?  Well, I could use a transpose
      signal to tell the pitch calls what's going on.  I think I might just
      need the frequency of the melody note.
    . Do an analysis pass, and insert environment that says what the harmony
      is.  Then pitch calls use that to tune.  Doing the analysis might be
      tricky since I have to extract a "principle pitch" from each event,
      but it might be useful in general to have an analysis framework.

Perform:
  - Overlapping notes with different ControlSwitch cc numbers should share
    a channel.  Of course it'll work anyway if only one channel is
    allocated.
    . Currently they definitely won't, because the performer assumes that
      all controls affect the sound, and so you can't share with any control.
  - Pick the best channel instead of the first one.
    . An event can share a channel if it has different controls but the events
      don't overlap.  This is required so that a sequence of notes that each
      set a different control will go on the same channel.  But since it always
      picks the first usable channel, you can have controls trade channels,
      depending on how the coincident events are sorted:
        [(0, 1, c1), (0, 1, c2), (1, 1, c2), (1, 1, c1)]
      This should put the c1s together, but they will trade channels if they
      come in that order.
    . I think to fix this I'd have to have can_share_chan return
      Left fail_reason or Right priority, and pick the highest priority.
      It would have to give a lower priority to events that could share, but
      have incompatible controls just out of the event range.
    . let f = Perform.shareable_chan
      let mkevent start controls pitch =
              Perform.Event inst1 start 0.33 controls
                  (Signal.signal [(0, pitch)]) DeriveTest.fake_stack
      let pedal = Map.fromList [("pedal", Signal.signal [(0, 1), (6, 0)])]
      pprint (f [(mkevent 3.33 pedal 45, 0)] (mkevent 3.66 mempty 72))

  - I can work around the pianoteq tuning bug by not stripping redundant
    conrol changes.  This also means that recorded MIDI can be played from any
    point.  If bandwidth isn't a concern then why not?
  - damper pedal causes all notes to extend until the pedal comes up, should
    the performer know about that?  Is there anything that this breaks?
    I don't think so, it affects channel allotment so notes could be
    improperly joined, but mixing pedal and multiplexing seems rare enough.
  - Perform.Midi.Perform: should be possible to lead keyswitches as long as
    they don't precede the previous NoteOn, since I think samplers will only
    switch on the next NoteOn

Util.Format:
  HsPretty:
    problems:
      . Missing close paren after wrapped constructors.
      . If I add an indent after each constructor then I get tons of indents.
        What I really want is a way to collapse multiple constructor calls
        with a single argument.
      . For some reason it's not wrapping tuples properly, they become
          (a, B

          )
        instead of

OSC backend

  - Write a simple supercollider instrument and try controlling that with OSC.

    a scheduler server that takes bundles and emits their msgs at the correct
    time.

jack: JACK: linux midi:
  bugs
    - something is still wrong, I get "no space in output port" and then
      corrupted output
    ? jack1 doesn't work at all: other clients don't see writes, until I quit,
      and then they get continuously spammed.  Apparently the jack_port_t*
      from the registration and the lookup are different.
      - Try stashing port from port_by_name port instead of jack_register_port.
  - does jack not support sysex at all?  Maybe I can't use it at all then.
  - Ensure that shutdown stuff is being called correctly.  I don't care but
    maybe JACK does?
  use jack transport
    I don't think I need to be the master.
    - When starting a play, call jack_transport_locate,
      then jack_transport_start().  The play then blocks on a lock which is
      released by JackSyncCallback when it gets a JackRolling state.
    - Register with jack_set_sync_callback.  JackSyncCallback sets a syncing
      flag, emits a Msg that forces the needed bits of performance, then that
      cmd must call back and reset the flag, at which point the sync function
      can return true.
    Then the next step is to test, and then figure out a way to get ardour to
    automatically set up a bunch of instruments and make MIDI in ports for
    them.

misc ideas:
  . What would a generalized staged evaluation system look like?
    E.g. evaluate note (start, dur) and first pitch track.  Then go through
    again and evaluate the rest of the tracks.  The second time the
    neighbors are now incomplete Score.Events with timing and pitch.
    I would also flatten out the block structure and cancel weak notes so
    I have access to true next and prev.  This implies some way to stash the
    unevaluated tracks in the Score.Event.  Then a postproc pass would go
    through and evaluate again, providing new context to the unevaluated bits.
    . I already have something vaguely like this in the Inversion dynamic
      state.  I can provide new context with Dynamic... though it would be an
      essentially untyped way to do it since there's no type difference
      between the first and second evaluation.
    . At the moment I don't need a generalized solution, so I could just
      hardcode:
      event_stage2 :: Maybe (([Score.Event], [Score.Event]) -> NoteDeriver)
      Then at conversion time, any event with an event_stage2 is replaced by
      its evaluation.
    . Conversion isn't quite right, because I still want next event on track
      etc... but actually no, I've been here before.
    . Then I need some way to specify notation that wants to wait until
      conversion.  I guess it would go by track, so maybe a magic symbol in
      the track title.  Then slicing separately returns slices from those
      tracks.  These still have to be evaluated in their original environment,
      so I then wrap in a derive_tracks and store as a NoteDeriver.
    . So I think this could work... but is it really worth it?  It seems like
      it introduces a whole new level of complexity.  And, if I go the
      typesafe route, a whole new type of calls, which a new accompanying
      namespace.
  . Import or trace curve from a pitch tracker into the pitch track.
  . Staff notation represents chords well, but tracks don't.  Think of a more
    compact notation.
  . Why can't I write a 'tr' that generates pitch signal in some cases, and
    adds an attribute in others?  It would be redesigning control tracks so
    they are just note tracks that slice their children and apply
    a transformer to them.  I'm not sure that will coexist with the curve
    description language that control tracks currently implement.
    It would be interesting to get rid of track types entirely though.

tracklang problems
  . It's too low level for chord-oriented music like piano.  For instance, I
    have to care about which note is on which track, while staff notation
    only has one way to write the cord.  So I have to do busywork like sorting
    notes by pitch, or copy pasting notes around between hands.  The whole
    thing about "what track is it on" is a result of the proportional time
    display, otherwise the horizontal position is unnecessary complexity.
  . The way that note, pitch, and dyn are separate is a hassle for reading and
    for editing.  Automatic pitch track selection and collapsing helps a bit,
    but it's still awkward.
  . Also it's not so easy to differentiate all those tracks, especially if
    every pitch track has its dyn track.
  . It can also be complicated to copy paste around if there is a bit of
    non-trivial structure like parent note tracks.
  . It's still hard for me to see relative positions and chords just from
    text.  Staff notation seems much easier.  Also hard to see enharmonic
    spelling.
  Solutions?
    . Theoretically lilypond could give the advantages of staff notation for
      reading only, but it's too slow for realtime update.
    . So as an extreme solution I could have a high speed staff display
      of the current surroundings.  Of course all this only helps with
      reading, not writing.
    . More utils like LNote.sort_on_pitch to automate away hassle could help
      with writing, but not reading.  So maybe it's worth trying to make
      sort_on_pitch more robust.

long term:
  - midi record
  - dense / efficient control signals
  - stable api
  - solution for per score haskell
  - text score
  - non-realtime synthesizer: doc/dev_notes/synthesizer
    - include audio inline, so I can write signal transforms like event
      transforms
  - horizontal layout
  - Unify environ, controls, and pitch signals by making signals of
    arbitrary type.

planning / research
  text score: doc/dev_notes/text-score.md
    . Time problems:
      . I want to say "repeat n times".
      . I want sections with their own tempo, and then the caller just sequences
        them.  If I turn the whole thing into one call, then I can still fit it
        into a global timeline, and apply transformations or tempo there.
      . If there is meter information in the text score, I can derive a ruler.
    * Perhaps I should have a ToCall class, for types which can turn into
      tracklang CallIds.  Used by KendangBali.to_call, and Derive.Solkattu.*.
    . I could generalize Pitch.Pitch to 'Pitch pc'.  Then Bounded types would
      have per_octave built-in, but I could still use Int for generic cases.
    . Rhythmic framework: in the solkattu branch I extracted the rhythmic DSL
      to 'Note a | TempoChange (Speed | Nadai)' and I have have generic
      functions to get durations and check tala alignment using matras, and
      flatten to (Time Ratio, a).
    . This winds up being more general than haskore, but probably less general
      than music-suite.  It looks like 'temporal-media' is analogous, though
      with arbitrary time shift/stretch, and events have duration.  Also since
      it uses (start, dur, note) events, it doesn't need rests, and can do
      overlapping events.

  things for expressive music
    There needs to be some way for notes to affect surrounding notes.  For
    example
      . A trill might want to push the next note back a bit so it can complete
        its cycle.
      . Portamento might want to put controls points on a curve, so the speed
        a distance between pitches affects how quickly they approach, and
        quick notes will have less accurate pitch.
      . Gender tick affects the damping of the previous note.
      . If I control uses bezier curves, the curve is determined by the last
        control point of the previous and the first point of the current call.
    Other ideas:
      . Switch samples when played quickly.
      . Drum thing where successive strokes lose some energy.
    . Randomization is a first step, but true variation in playing is not
      random.  Things to study:
      . Tempo variation.  This is related to intentional tempo variation, but
        there should be slight tempo variations all the time.  This also has
        to do with higher level controls like rushing or lagging, and slight
        amounts of swing.
        E.g. some instruments may tend to rush when they want to be more
        prominent, or get louder.
      . Start / duration variation.  Related to tempo but at a lower level and
        less systematic.  Interpretation of staccato depends on surrounding
        tempo.
      . Dynamic variation.  Many instruments tend to get louder at higher
        pitches.  Tempo speed up tends to increase volume.
      . Pitch variation.  Some instruments tend to attack inaccurately and
        then correct.  Higher dynamics and tempo could make pitch less
        accurate.
    Modelling notation as a set of constraints:
      Notation specifies parameters along with how "fixed" they are.  For
      example, specified pitches are usually immovable, but onset time might
      be variable, depending on how important the beat is.  Higher level
      notation then assembles components and combines the constraints, and
      results in either conflicts, or a set of more specific constraints.

      . Example: janta attacks from below, normally one diatonic step, but
        avoids repeating the previous note.  A trill can end on either low
        or high, but if followed by janta, will change to avoid making janta
        repeat a note.  If trill speed is unfixed, it can change that,
        otherwise change attack time of the following note.  If the trill end
        is fixed, then the grace note must adapt by picking another higher
        note.
      . Carnatic ornaments change when time is reduced.

  think about grammar for ornaments
    . Notes have a syntax: there are ornaments or articulations only valid at
      the attack time, ones that apply to the sustain, and ones that serve as
      transitions to the next note.  Also, the shapes of ornaments vary based on
      the note or absence of a note preceding and following, in addition to the
      speed.  It makes me think of cursive Arabic, where letters change shape
      and placement based on the previous letter, along with rules about which
      letters go where in the word (I'm sure linguists have a name for this,
      e.g. English has "ng", but won't start a word with it).  I've noticed
      there's a tension between specifying exact times via a timeline or
      whatever, and the kind of higher level flexibility implied by a syntactic
      approach.  E.g. if you say "attack X, sustain Y, end with Z", you are not
      saying exactly when X, Y, and Z start and end, and they are free to
      arrange themselves according to context.  But you do need a certain amount
      of precise control over times, at least in some cases.
    . This is similar to the "constraints" idea, at least with regard to some
      aspects being flexible, while others are fixed.  For instance, if
      I write ornaments with no specific times: 'A; B; C' then the start times
      and durations are flexible, and its up to the interpreting code to
      arrange them, but if I make separate events for A, B, and C, then the
      times are fixed.  Of course I also want to be able to fix A and C, but
      leave B's position flexible.
    . How to represent this as events?  I think I need a "macro" facility,
      where a call can interpret following events as a separate mini-language.
      I used to have this, and could probably get it back, by re-introducing
      the "skip following events" return value.  In that case, some notation
      like a leading '=' would indicate that the start time is fixed.
      Otherwise, the event_start is irrelevant except that it's in between
      the previous and next events.
    . Or maybe I do it as sub-notes, that way the one on the left specifies
      the extent of the "note DSL", and I don't need a "skip following" hack.

  . Give a visual indication of the events emitted by a call.  This is the
    note level version of the track signal render.  The underlying problem is
    that textual call names are not necessarily very clear about what the
    notes are, especially if it's a relatively ad-hoc call.  But I think
    I need a fancier GUI for this, since I'd have to have some way of turning
    a bunch of events into a distinctive looking graphic, e.g. a scaled down
    image of the block or something.

    controls can I get low latency high res controls?
