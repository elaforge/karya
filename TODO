bugs
  * scoped_ptr causing crash at shutdown
  * tracks added from hs don't get drawn
    fix this so I can demonstrate bugs with hs code
  - figure out redraw situation.  when do I have to call it?
  - tracks get misaligned when dragging them back and forth in MoveTile
  - vertical move totally screwed up, disable it

interface
  * use main thread for ui
  - get/set block config, block view config
  - BlockView.set_track_width
  - track_at

ui
  - make TrackPos into an opaque type to let me be more free with impl.
    implement as int64 usec?  or since it's just block relative, I can use
    plain unsigned msec?
  - zoom and scroll
  event track
    - events
    - overlay ruler
  - ruler: text labels

  find out how to draw:
    - transparent selections
    - background graphs / antialiased lines

app
  - actions
  - msg -> action mapping

research
  - download sequencers and see how they ship midi reliably
  - investigate hs-plugins and xmonad to see about hs plugin possibilities
    xmonad just recompiles the whole app
    I could actually do that at first too
  - learn about hs gtk for reference

future
  - check out jack some more.  I don't necessarily support it in the beginning
  but should have an idea at least.
    Looks like I could use it for midi i/o, but what's the advantage over
    e.g. portmidi?  Maybe the ability to send midi to e.g. local apps in
    standalone mode?  Or would be be better to support vst?
  - vst interface
  - liblash would let me save plugin / jack configuration
