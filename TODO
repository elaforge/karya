  play midi msgs from the repl
    * change UpdaterArgs to PlayMidiArgs and generalize to play any list of
      msgs
    * block_id turns into a plain string description
    * I think multiplier and start can be baked into the inv_tempo
    * But for a repl cmd to return PlayMidi, I need to have it return
      non-String.  Should be possible, but how do I make the common case work?
      Use a typeclass to select Show-able vs. Cmd.Status?  No I think the
      cmds have to be monomorphic.
      Could return by setting a variable.
      The problem is that the return value is already taken to display to
      the REPL.
    * I think I need to shift events back.
    * space doesn't work to stop the play
      It's because the I rely on the updater emitting Transport.Stopped when
      signaled from the player.
      If there isn't necessarily an updater, I need to emit Stopped directly
      from the player.  It was originally this way because if there are
      multiple players then the updater would be the single coordinator.
      Maybe when there's no updater I could have one that just blocks on the
      player status.
    - Rename updater to play monitor.
    - Indicator for play status.
  - can I cache long blocks by slicing them if they're >n?
  - 'u' and 'd' have a problem with long notes because pitches can only be
    transposed so far
  - pitch call: like interpolate next, but default to .1s
  * crescendo in echo bit isn't getting split properly, each track should be
    on its own channel.
    Should be able to extract just a few notes, then turn on perform logging.
    So the guys under the curve in track 1 should share, but they aren't.
    * Still not quite right, some events are now being shared that shouldn't
      be shared.
  - I have a feeling like FM8 doesn't obey ResetAllControls
    Maybe I should extend Midi.Interface.note_tracker to keep track of
    used CCs to issue resets for them.  Some reset to 1, e.g. cc2 and cc7,
    the rest reset to 0.
    But filtering the midi shows dyn controls mixed into both channels.
  - redraw problem on sloped signals
  - support poly aftertouch
  * pitch signal redraw messed up in save/untitled
  - in addition, it seems the signal doesn't update if I change the default
    environ assignment on another track
  cache tracks
    - put the "cached" log msg at the end of the cache results?
      Otherwise it immediately forces all of them.
      Wait, why should it?  Just cons on the front.
  parallelism?
    . why does priming take so long?
      It needs the tempo.  Since signals are eager, that means evaluating
      the tempo track at least.  But not just tempo obviously, or it would be
      fast.
      What else?  Well, I need signals if they are being rendered.
    - Can I fork a spark for each note track being merged?
      Perhaps I should abandon the idea fo lazy derivation, it's likely not
      happening anyway.  I still want the evaluation incremental, but I could
      parallel force each track.
    - Try Util.AppendList again, but just at the track and block call level.
      At the block level it's to reduce copying, at the track level I can
      run a strategy on a multi-way merge to eval them in parallel.
      . Does this offer an advantage over embedding the parallel in BlockUtil?
        Well, parallelism depends on evaluation, and the track derivation is
        lazy.  So I think I'd have to put some bangs in track derivation.
      . Maybe I should try that anyway?
  strict derivation
    - If I'm forcing entirely, I can put in a merge at the cache level, so
      tracks and blocks would become merges, but all other calls are just (++)
      as before.  Then I can apply a parallel strategy at the merge level.
    - Also, consecutive signals should be mconcated.
  - try giving a big heap to speed startup? +RTS -H512m
  control memory leaks
    . Lots of lag and drag.
    . How big is each event?  Maybe the caches aren't so expensive because they
      share events?
    . Alternately, I could try doing the strict/parallel thing, and see if
      that clears it up.  Or at least strictifying.
    * use strict pair for cache entry (collect, events)
    * force the events when priming a perf
    * try lifecycle profiling, lots of void and drag
    * try retainer profiling
      - it's buggy and crashes, go mention it on the ghc bug
    - The drag is Map, and is eliminated when I clear the performances
      Narrow it down.
      . Forcing does nothing, but clearing the cache gets rid of a big
        portion.
    - If each event or unevaluated event has future and past it will keep
      the UI alive.  Maybe forcing the result of each event will clean that
      up.
  - maybe pitch signal render could normalize on low and high, that way it's
    not all up against the right side
  add 'approach' call
    * do just plain 'a' approach call first
      use eval_event to get the next pitch
    . For this I need to know the next value.  So I need a way to evaluate the
      future.
    . But then I need to parse the future.  But control tracks use a different
      parser.  So either add a is_control flag to CallInfo, and make every
      derive have to tell if it's a control track or not, or add a self_eval
      val call to 'scope_control'.
    . The former is pretty icky, but the latter involves more overhead, and
      p_unsigned_float is near the top of the profile.  Of course, I don't
      really understand the profile, since the top is Serialiaze.get.
    . Fundamentally there is different parsing for control tracks.  So eval
      calls need to know if they are in a control track.  Even if I use the
      self_eval trick, then I need a ControlScope.  But that happens by
      type inference, since there's a lookup_callable method.

    * add (<) and (>) val calls for the previous and next val, respectively
    * This means val calls are also going to need next events.  Should be ok.
    * I also need the track type.
      Otherwise I don't know how to evaluate the events, this is tied to
      ValCall being monomorphic.

  make TrackLang.Symbol into ByteString?
    . means fewer conversions
    . maybe faster lookups
    . But ByteString is not necessarily more compact for small strings, e.g.
      1 char = 4 words, 2 char = 8 words
    . Actually space isn't a big concern, it's probably more about looking
      up in maps, bytestrings may be faster, but on the other hand strings can
      abort early in comparison.
    . Also ByteString is pinned.
    / I think the number of calls is actually not that high.  Doesn't seem
      worth it.
  * quantize, so I can clean up pno-vla
  * figure out why the note after 'd 20' is bogus
  load midi
    - order tracks with low pitches to the left
    * making bad parent->child
    * what's more, bad skel can kill the responder:
      **** Cmd/Responder.hs:381 [run_continue] - sync_status: skeleton of (bid
      "pnovla2/b1") names missing tracknums: [0]
    * use 0x instead of .123
  vsl
    * put keyswitches in specific->general order
    find out what they mean
      . auto - attack automation?
    * strings orchestra
    * include the various non-articulation matrices: legato, portato, etc.
    * fix matrix ks for cello and bass, it probably isn't c2
      And also other bass instruments.
    * Check presets for other instruments manually, they aren't necessarily
      the same.
    / putting the matrix keyswitch on adds a redundant ks on every note,
      revisit note emitting leading keyswitches.  Or just filter as before,
      but make sure vsl keeps the horizontal setting.
      No, you only get ks when it changes.
    * harp
    * check if the same articulations really are the same, if so, filter them
      out
    * replace sec# with short and long?
    * include up/down variants via. mode keyswitch
      I could do that with a special updown attr that is replaced with
      a ks with up and a ks with down.
    * fix instruments whose keyswitches are above rather than below
    / add level 2 samples
  / Score.instrument should strip invalid chars
    The thing is, MidiDb strips them before joining them with the synth name.
  * make Id a ByteString instead of String, that should speed up (==)
  * shake does a complete rebuild if I build something else
    what's going on?  Is it related to the hsconfig.h change?
  slow
    - fltk drawing is slow
    - maybe slower when there's haskell behind it?
    - rederiving is slow
    - it also makes the UI seize up, even when it should be waiting?
    big block is slow
      * track level caching should speed up rederives
  and scrolling the giant block is super slow!
    * profile says it's in Perf.find_play_pos
    - drawing is stil slow, I'll have to look at the fltk layer
      It happens when the block is wide.  Use test_block to see if it's just
      fltk.
      . It's fltk.  Not alpha draw though.
      Scrolling is weirdly chunky near the top when fl_scroll() is on.
      Curiously it doesn't seem to help at all.
    - Would it be faster to call fl_scroll once for all the tracks?  I could
      also theoretically call find_events all at once too, though that
      shows up low on the profile, so maybe it's not a big deal.
    . The thing is, it seems like fl_scroll doesn't actually help scrolling
      speed at all.  Maybe all the time is spent elsewhere?

  * browser: show keyswitches in a nice tabular format
  * I have my old scores saved as MIDI, right?  Write a MIDI loader?
  * why is it that [(1, "")] [(0, 0, "4c"), (1, 0, "i (4d)")] gives the wrong
    pitch?  I'm guessing the pitchbend msg gets out of order on the single
    channel available.
  - should instrument bound keys (i.e. drum strokes) work in ValEdit?
    It's awkward to have to go back and forth from kbd entry.
  - trill or trem with negative duration lines the integral number up to the
    end.
  timestep
    - timestep 64*2 skips two 's', because 's' is the minimum match
      skip should be ignored when the match is a larger rank than exists, or
      maybe step should fail.

    * will need timstep calls, e.g. as a trill arg
    * So I need a parseable and succinct notation for timesteps
    - use NE list for TimeStep
    - TimeStep should support negative skip as a fractional skip
    - points use vector instead of list
      But then I lose laziness.  Maybe only worth it if I cache.
    - cache points by returning CachedTimeStep = Points
    - TimeStep.snap should optimize steps that don't do any snapping when
      prev_val is Nothing, e.g. RelativeMark and Absolute
    * Absolute is badly named, it should be Relative
  - NoteTransformers apply a transformer to notes.  So why can't I apply
    any transformer as a note transformer?  NoteTransformers are actually more
    powerful because they can treat multiple args differently, but any
    transformer should be lifted.
    If I make "" work as a note transformer, then I can write 'trans |',
    right?  But that also means if I apply "" directly to subtracks it'll just
    output them directly, do I really want that?  It's kind of a way of
    grouping them together so the transformer can apply to them.
    Then 'harmonic' is the same as 'n +harmonic |' is the same as
    'attrs = +harmonic'
    But "" is already inverting!
  - the same place that updates the status could use updates to clear caches
    for cmds or for TimeStep
    Clear when: inst changed, so if any performance was regenerated.  In fact,
    if I put the cache in the performance then this happens automatically.
    But where do I put it while the performance is still waiting?  I guess
    I can stick stuff in the performance without forcing the events.

  * responder should catch exceptions
  - doesn't seem to save track widths, I keep making it narrow but reload it's
    still wide.
  - Managed to crash by undoing while editing, I think.  I wound up with
    note events on a control track and when I tried to undo and delete it
    I got an update on wrong kind of track assertion error.
  - Sometimes tick makes more sense as at attribute of the previous note, or
    perhaps a freestanding ornament, since it can happen or not on a repeat.
  - I do a lot of appending a block along with its ruler, I could have
    a single cmd to do that.
  - A more radical approach would be a block mode where the block calls are
    simply additive, and their duration doesn't matter.  This would mean I'd
    have to edit the tempo on the subblocks though, which in turn means it
    couldn't vary independently.

  memory leak
    . It seems like starting editing pnovla, it takes 1-2s to rederive, but
      eventually take 5s.
    - Run under EKG.  I thought I saw memory drop after scrolling the UI?

  ghc panics
    - Stress test: load a score, apply a change, wait for rederive, apply
      another, etc.
      I can use the same thing to watch memory.
    - Extend it to do UI.
    . How to compile it?  It should be with opt but not necessarily profiling.
      Wait, I do want at least SCC-less profiling to get the heap trace.
      Make a separate binary and put it in opt/.
      That way I can hook up the UI too.  But how to drive it?
      . Use Lang, in fact I could just drive the normal seq.  Add a few Fast
        cmds to add and remove events, and to force the current perf.
        But I can't interact, e.g. wait for it
        to be done, all I can do is spam cmds.  Of course if I want to run it
        until it crashes that's enough.
      . Try to extend ResponderTest to talk to the UI.
    - Uses:
      . Chase the derive memory leaks.
      . Trigger the libgit2 memory corruption.
      . Trigger the fltk memory corruption.

    . It still happens without git, but seems less frequent.
      Maybe both libgit2 and finalization have a problem.
      But it happens with finalizers commented out, though seemingly much more
      rarely.
      . LibGit2 sets alignment to sizeOf... is that right?
    + try commenting out finalizers, maybe it's incorrect finalization
      Look for use after free?
    look for problem in git
      first eyeball
        - verify signatures: LibGit2
        - verify usage: Git2
      - then write a stress test: large score, make a change, save, rederive,
        repeat
    * change all alignment = 1 lines to 4.  Still crashes.  But less?
    * try on linux, yes seems to happen there too
    * use valgrind on linux
    * See if it happens without LangGhc. Yes.
    * See if it happens in debug mode. Yes.
    * See if -O2 debug binary crashes. Yes, at least once.
    * See if -O0 opt binary crashes.
    * Try with the shell version of git.  If that works, update libgit2.
      No, it's probably not git.
    + try with no git at all, i.e. turn off git saving and save normally
      Yes, but rarely?
    - should opt/ghci-flags have -O?
    It seems likely due to FFI, perhaps a bug in C++.  Optimization could be
    making some change that makes it more sensitive to the bug.  Or it could
    be optimization in the c++.

    I need a repro.  Profiling doesn't do it.  Maybe it's due to the UI?  Can
    I automate lots of UI banging?

  - rename Ruler.marks_of to marklist_to_list and Ruler.
  / parsing "1r" instead of "1s" gives a "unexpected eof" error msg, it should
    say 'r' was an unknown suffix
    Can't get attoparsec to consistently report an error.  Kind of hard when
    it always backtracks.
  - It seems confusing that in val edit the note track doesn't need cmd-x but
    the control track does.
    Maybe I should get rid of the optional cmd- thing?
  - Hand damping: manually place hand damp positions.   Post proc, where tick
    and ngoret ornaments set an attribute or something so it knows which ones
    to extend.
  trompong / reyong:
    - trompong ngoret, actually I can use rambat tick
    - split to ngembat, e.g.  λ 人 hmm, is there a reverse lambda?  Can I draw
      symbols reversed? 入 兩
    - various numpuk
    - makilit / kilitan derivations from melody
  calls to define randomized scores:
    - alternate b1 b2 b3 - calls one of variant calls
    - how could I omit a transformer?
  / Pretty on a lot of events causes a stack overflow
    Can't reproduce.
  - solo on one track in a sub-block causes all other blocks to be filtered out.
    It seems more intuitive that it only apply to that block.  That means solo
    would have to record the block that it's soloed on, and only filter events
    on that block.  Or simpler, turn a solo into a mute of all the other
    tracks.
  - Also, solo can no longer be used to temporarily turn off a controls track.
  Just scales, along with TwelveUtil support
    - interpolate between just scales in different keys
  - It's a bit unpleasant how I have TwelveUtils for accidental and key using
    scales, then Scale.Util for simple scales, and then Just is its own thing.
    Can I unify things into one framework?

  fancier pitch signals:
    - Pitch signal render:
      To get it right, Pitch needs to emit (Note, Note, Frac) and send that to
      fltk instead of NNs.  But I'm not sure I even want it, the NNs actually
      look ok.
    - Lilypond enharmonics: they way I spelled it on the score should be the
      way it's spelled in lilypond.  (Note, Note, Frac) can do this but it's
      actually overkill since I'll probably just pick the bottom Note.
    - to_relatve: This needs Note - Note = Semis.  I think I could just add
      a field in Scale, but I'm not totally sure I really want this.

  - Derive.Call.Note.randomized should randomize start for 0 dur notes
  Space usage.  On startup it balloons up to 450mb, what is it doing?  After
    a bit of editing it's up to 750mb, who is leaking?  Undo history?
    * Write size profile that loads a big score and reports the size increase.
    - Write function to sum up State, Cache, and Performance sizes.
      Return stats about event size, etc.
    / Try interning strings on load.
      Savings are negligable, provided I'm calculating them correctly.
    - Flatten pointers out of data structures.
      Which ones? Cached Events, performed MIDI.
    * Discard old undo states.
    - Link libraries into seq as shared, also link with ghc api as shared.
      Ask on ghc-users first if anyone has done this.
    Compact cached signals and rendered MIDI.
      - First write tests that demonstrate where the space is going.
      - UNPACK Derive.Score.Event
      - Midi.Midi.WriteMessages compact as a lazy storablevector
    - Compact control tracks when I have that in, maybe compact only on
      checkpoints?
      But savings are likely to be very small for handwritten scores, would
      only make a difference for recorded control tracks.
    The ghc api uses tons of space when it starts linking in everything.
      - How much space does ghci take loading the same stuff?  Why so much
        less?
      - I probably have the whole app twice.  Can I use dynamic libraries to
        improve this?

  - There's a lot of duplication between State.TrackEvents, Call.TrackInfo,
    and Derive.CallInfo.  Can I factor out the common bits?
  keys / scales / Theory:
    - support scales that are different ascending vs. descending
    - twelve, but relative to key and using numbers, aka jianpu
    - letter and jianpu but with implicit accidentals based on the key

  - if I added the cmd name before running the cmd, I could put it in the
    error msg when an exception is caught.
  - Breath kbd_input keys only work if chorded with a note, since otherwise
    controls with a NoteOff'ed note_id are not emitted.  Change this?
  - Suppressed undo for val edit is surprising since I tend to do a lot of
    edits without leaving val edit.  Maybe don't do it for pitch val edit.
    Try going back to using the name to suppress, but ignore cmds with no
    name.
  - There are still some cmds without names, who are they?
    Do some logging to track them down.
  incremental save
    + try saving individual events for incremental save
      Seems to be just as slow as full save, probably most of the time is in
      the call to git.  Test again with larger tracks.
    - wrap operations in a lock file
    - make sure things are ok if it fails at any step
    - I don't think Ui.State needs to emit CmdTrackAllEvents for cases where
      diff will catch it.
    - Make sure that when a project changes name all the history comes with
      it.  I guess I'd have to copy the dir, or do a git clone.  If I copied
      the dir that wouldn't work with 'untitled' because I don't want all
      those other heads.  I want to copy over the current history.
      So I want to clone everything from the current commit.
      Is there a git cmd to do that?
      git clone --bare ...?
      Get all commits, then copy all commits along with referents.
      Much simpler to just copy the whole dir and then optionally trim the
      other refs and gc as a separate operation.
      - So I need the rename cmd to also mv or cp the underlying repo, if any.
    - Why should I ever do a complete save?  Why not always just do partial?
      The repo should only contain one copy of something that never changes.
      One reason is to trim history, but maybe for that I should have a option
      to rename and save without bringing the history.
      So save is just a tag operation, it doesn't actually dump state.  This
      will remove the irregularity where a save state corresponds to no
      history entry.
      But then how do I start the saving?  I would need a special value to say
      it should start saving.  Binding to ^S is logical, but then the first
      save doesn't add a tag.  Unless the first save always tags.
      - Initially save_checkpoints is false, so no checkpointing
      - cmd_save makes it true, then Undo does a checkpoint
        But it has to notice the false -> true transition, otherwise it will
        consider the cmd not worth saving.  So hist_save_checkpoints is just
        True for the cmd that turns it on, and goes off after that.
    - Ability to give names to SavePoints.
    - See if git's delta compression understands binary and can compress
      tracks.  Otherwise, would it be worth helping it by e.g. separating
      each event with a newline?  But then it makes serializing events more of
      a hassle.
    Git docs: http://progit.org/book/ch9-2.html

  - It can be really confusing how undo and redo makes windows pop up and
    disappear.  Maybe I should make undo not affect views at all?
  - I could have a Cmd state flag that does things relative to the current
    block vs. root block
    - LPerf functions
    - play
  - do the 'play this list of events' thing, send it over to the play thread
    just without an updater, so space will still kill it

  - key not applied in inner blocks, local play should take the root play's
    env as a starting point
  - Cmd.Lang.LPitch.to_relative: I would need to implement Scale.scale_diff
    but I'm reluctant until I need to_relative or something similar

  complete quickcheck derive testing
    I switched back to Double for RealTime, but this means the roundoff errors
    are back.  Use quickcheck to repro them.
    * make Arbitrary for BlockSpecs
    + make a simple deriver that creates event and midi output skeletons
    - integrate quickcheck with generate_run_tests.py
    - assert that the reduced deriver output equals the simple deriver output
    - basic pitches: If the score was created with notes aligned to note
      starts, then every NoteOn should have the appropriate key, there should
      be no pitch bends, and "same note" should be the only reason for
      a channel split
    - basic controls: Given randomly placed control events, notes have the
      correct control curves.  Don't worry about times or midi.
    - slicing: Given some simple note transformers (tuple, place, ...),
      pitches and controls are still associated with the right notes as above.
      Don't worry about times, just that the right notes and the right
      controls.
    - block call property: a couple levels of nesting for block calls, notes
      still have the expected pitches and controls as above
    - inversion: as 'basic pitches' and 'basic controls', but controls are
      below the note tracks, results should be the same
    - stack: generate nested events, check that stack is as expected

  - it's annoying how a track with nothing in it won't play, and has no
    playback.
  - when I implement control block calls, I might want to override a control
    at certain points.  It should be possible to add a 'merge' operator that
    replaces samples.  Is still no good if the samples don't line up, but I'll
    need an event-level merge anyway for notes.

  - tempo composition is problematic because it means you can't change the
    length of a block from within the block.  So slowing down one part will
    speed up another.  How can I get local tempo like I want?  Or just edit
    the global tempo?  Unfortunately it's much more convenient to edit local
    tempo.  Maybe I could do a non-compositional tempo that simply overrides
    the caller, or rather multiplies with the caller.
    This means the call event is now longer than its duration would imply,
    and to fix that I need to have the child tempo modify the parent.  So
    effectively I am just modifying the global tempo, only providing a nicer
    syntax.

    This technique really is non-compositional: you can't have more than
    one call at once.
    Actually, I could: tempo track looks at calls in note tracks, gets
    sub-blocks, strips out the tempo tracks.  Then multiplies those signals
    with its own.

    Or I could just make it easier to edit the global tempo:
      * when you click on the parent, show selection pos on the child too
      - show derivation of child inside caller, I think I want to do this
        anyway, but it's hard, how do I fit all that stuff in?
      * merge child rulers with parent?
      But it still seems a bit awkward because I do want the tempo associated
      with the music, e.g. when I play by itself.  On the other hand, if the
      block repeats do I want the tempo to repeat as well?  Sometimes yes,
      sometimes no...
  - try to make TrackEnviron lazy
  - after an uncollapse, it doesn't redraw the selection that was underneath
    Not a big deal since a selection shouldn't be underneath but still...
  - randomize any control by having the 'set' call look for the -rnd control
  * some way to get symbol feedback instantly to make it easier to compose them
    - But it calls SymbolC and I ran into a problem where linux ghci can't
      link FFI-using functions.  Ask on glasgow-haskell-users.

  wait until I want it
    - shift [ and ] undo and redo zooms.  or one key to toggle last zoom?
    - do tuplets by setting local ruler?
    - lang cmd to show state hierarchically... or does it already exist?

  debugging
    - cmd to save and load cache to disk
    - add a Play.play_msgs function that plays the given msgs, normalizing so
      fst event is at 0.  Use to debug: LPerf.sel_midi >>= Play.play_msgs

  - test sending mtc to reapaer
    also test some mmc commands.  How does reaper support control surfaces?

  - playback should have multiple lines when a block is derived multiple
    times have a set of playback selnums?
  - If I quit and then restart, the second start takes a long time.  What's
    it waiting on?  Midi init?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

documentation
  + doc/derivation.md
  * integrate doc/tracklang into derivation.md
  - split up derivation.md into separate files
  * doc/performance.md, and reorganize derivation under it, and integrate with
    doc/score.md
  - doc/ui.md
  - doc/cmd.md
  call doc:
    - I could go look through arg docs for controls and list all the controls
      that have someone listening to them in a certain scope.
    - linkify single quotes

integrate / integration:
  - adding a {soft} stroke appears to apply the soft again the the dyn track
  - bug: can't delete a derived track, it just gets regenerated
  - bug: can't undo past a integrate create, it just creates a new one
    Maybe I could not record the integrate step?
  - bug: create tracks, remove <, re-add <, does it work?
    Removing < should break the integrate links.

  / Optimize block integration: similar to only_destinations_damaged,
    if only the destination blocks are damaged, don't rederive the source.
    Actually, this doesn't seem to be necessary.
  - single track mode that doesn't split tracks
  - integrate not logging means that integrate errors only show up on play
  - It may be possible to parallelize multiple integrations.
  - Convert.Tracks should mirror TrackDestination structure.  Or
    parameterize TrackDestination?
  - Figure out how multiple levels of track integration work.
  - If integrate is committing changes to a track, can that bite me if
    a "canceled" derivation comes through?  Think about this later.
  - What if an integrate wants to produce a note transformer track?  I
    think that's currently impossible.
  - quantization
  - split tracks on overlapping notes since some calls make them (e.g. block
    calls)

lilypond:
  enough to render bloom nicely:
    - pedal should emit pedal sign
    - the manual pedal notes I guess should be pedal-ified
    / Why does the cmd have to wait until lilypond is done?  Should be async.
      No idea.  It says it wrote the response, but the repl doesn't give
      me a prompt back.  It's just a repl thing, the app continues normally.
    - staff group should put inst name on the group instead of each staff
    + add hand annotations to score
    - possibly support voices, should be able to do it the same as hand
      splitting
  - make rhythm spelling work properly for non-duple meters
  - support compound meters, e.g. 5/4 as 3+2 or 2+3
    TimeSignature needs to get fancier
  - get pitches right, and keep the enharmonics
  - manually add ly tweaks, could be done with special ly environ val
  * support for slurs, I think I write them as a NoteTransformer which
    attaches metadata.  It can also affect note durations in normal
    performance.  E.g. make it legato to trigger keyed legato.
  - is there a way to turn pitch signal calls e.g. 'tr' into an attr on the
    note? I can't totally override the pitch track because I still need the
    pitches, it needs to return attrs in addition to signal.  The only way
    I can think is another return val, e.g. collect [(RealTime, Attributes)]
  + can I make a click on a note in the pdf highlight in the sequencer?
    Hung up on getting preview to send clicks to a program, notes in
    App/LilypondClick.hs

negative duration / arrival beats:
  - Figure out how arrival works with controls.  It's most natural for
    a pitch for a call to go at the end of the call, but for that to work
    negative dur controls have to extend to their *previous* note.  Seems
    like this requires a flag on the control to use a different Signal.at.
    But that's not right for normal notes, whose pitch really does extend
    afterwards.

    Currently, if I want to set pitch or control for a call, I have to put the
    control slightly after the start of the call, so it encompasses the call
    but not the note before.  That's awkward.

    If -0 dur control points go from >start <=end, then the pitch has to go
    at the end of the event (earlier in time), which is even more awkward.

    I think the controls have to go at the note's start, and have to logically
    extend backwards to the note's end.  That means I can't write anything
    other than a straight pitch because the actual sounding note is implicit.
    So it has to be via integration
  - ensure inversion works (it should slice >start <=end)
  - ensure redraw works
    I have to make SymbolTable wrap text above too.

external
  - chorded keys are not getting the proper pitch bend
    It's a pianoteq problem.
    Track it down and send it to them?
  - problem with pianoteq: if the same note occurs on two channels, one
    will be dropped.  Report to pianoteq.  I could work around, but it won't
    occur with real multitimbral instruments anyway.
  + send a patch to improve Random.Shuffle?
  - patch for hsc2hs for #alignment
  srcloc_annotate pragma
    I think a ghc pragma is needed.
    - read up on how jhc does it
    - ask ghc-users if it's a good idea
    - figure out how to implement pragmas in ghc
  - add better symbol resolution to haddock
    document 'qualification' -q flag, add mode to show it as written

use fixed-binary instead of Doubles for ScoreTime and RealTime:
  reasons to do it:
    - get rid of custom implementation in Perform.RealTime
    - get rid of half-open except start==end hack for ranges, a point selection
      is simple (start, start+1).
    - RealTime.to_seconds is big on the profile
  reasons not to do it:
    - what to do about -0?  I could disallow 0 dur events and make control
      events have an eta dur
    - will fixed64 be slower?
  switch back to Double for RealTime, split from Timestamp for midi
    - but floating point imprecision make controls not be clipped to their
      notes properly.  I think this happened at the Deriver level, not Perform
  problems:
    too slow, I do lots of to_double conversions that are slow.
    Can I do all that math in Fixed?

plugins:
  - Either dynamically load local inst definitions and local StaticConfig, or
    auto-generate the link file Local/Instrument.hs.
  - come up with plan for reloading inst config and static config
    Really what I want to be able to do is recompile the static config
    incrementally, relink it with the main binary *quickly*, and restart the
    app with exactly the same state.  This should be a lightweight operation,
    so it's feasible to edit some code, press play, edit code, and play
    again.  That means a full-on serialize restart is out, because the cache
    could be quite large.

    Of course, you want this stuff in a library so it can be reused across
    projects, so you can put it all in Local/.  Then the song state would
    have a (hopefully minimal) linkage from hs namespaces to the tracklang
    namespaces.

    So with hs-plugins: The static config is considered a plugin.  You edit
    Local/Config.hs, or edit other files in Local/.  It detects the change,
    regenerates Local/Config.hs, recompiles and reloads it.  Then the
    responder is called again with the new static config.

    So I need to be able to re-initialize the responder with a new static
    config.  Actually, the bits I care about are the call map and the cmd
    map.

bugs:
  * Create.rename_project loses the merged tracks
  * track down ghc rts crashes, assertion failure
    - make a repro case if ghc guys want it
  - run under valgrind every once and a while, just for fun
    - why doesn't valgrind reveal bad memory access from haskell, e.g. poke...

cleanup:
  - split Ui.State into separate modules for views, blocks, tracks, etc.
    put into Ui.State.* and re-export from Ui.State
  - split up CallInfo depending on type
    I got started but was discouraged when it came time to write
    GetLastSample, maybe I should make another go.
    Note tracks can't get a GetLastSample at all.
  - as above, Derived could be called Cacheable, and Elem should be a separate
    type family
  - It would be more efficient to move events around if their controls were
    normalized to start from their beginning, so that you never have to modify
    the signals.  Of course, it's only worth it if events tend to get moved
    more than once.

  - Think about some way to formalize the identifier restrictions, currently
    it's only enforced in the tracklang parser.

    p_ident applies to: Attributes, Control, PitchControl, ScaleId
    Maybe it's enough that the parser restricts them?  That means no one
    will bother creating e.g. a bogus control name because it could't be used.
    Call names are explicitly anything-goes.  BlockIds should support at
    least some of it if they are supposed to be interchangeable with other
    calls.

    On the other hand, I don't think I care much if idents can have wacky
    names, they just won't be nameable from the tracklang.
  - storing TrackEvents without duration would make maintaining the
    no-overlap invariant easier.  E.g. have explicit 'off' events, otherwise
    each event extends to the next one.  It means after merging I have to
    clear redundant offs, but that's easier right?

  / instead of building log dup suppressing logic into various functions,
    e.g.  allot, maybe I can add 'key' field to Log.Msg and suppress dup
    keys?  Who else produces dups?  Convert does.  But isn't it more
    efficient to just not emit?
    - convert and perform want to suppress the same msgs for the current
      derivation
    - Perform.Midi.Cache.is_splice_failure is just a better way to identify
      the msg than text
    - cache wants to suppress all cache msgs until end of cached block
    The problem is that it's hard to know the boundaries of the current
    derivation, especially if there are multiple blocks being derived
    simultaneously.  I would have to put a block id key.  On the other hand,
    filtering in place knows that.  The extra copy is actually no worse than
    the filter at perform time, maybe better for cache since it only happens
    once.

performance:
  - look into Debug.Trace.traceEventIO to see how long various things take as
    in http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2012/10/future-work-warp
  efficient signals
    control
      - make Ui.Events into 'Map ScoreTime (Event | Chunk Signal)'
      - collapse chunks of adjacent 'set' calls into a Chunk
      - track_derive on a Chunk just returns the contents
      - fltk event render should detect too dense events and omit them, rely
        on the signal render
      - UI edits should see the Chunk expanded out as Events.  Inserting an
        event should modify the chunk or split it depending on if the inserted
        event is a set call or not.
    pitch
      Similar to control except I can't make Chunks automatically, since
      collapsing to NoteNumbers loses information.  But recording doesn't have
      this information in the first place, so it can generate chunks.
      However, maybe I should omit chunked pitch signals entirely and instead
      emit an initial pitch along with a transposition curve.

  - make seeks on derive output more efficient with a lazy index
  cache
    - Can I make cached signal more efficient by merging the signals before
      stashing it?  Of course laziness means that this won't actually happen
      until the next time the cache is demanded, unless I force it.
    - see if the cache filtering logs is causing significant copying and
      remove
  * make tracks into calls, so they cache and the sub-run stuff works the
    same with them as other calls
    It would be nice to make them calls in the scopes, so they can be
    rebound like other calls.  This is effectively moving the Schema into
    calls.  Then I can entirely get rid of it.
    * move Schema.default_schema_deriver into c_block
    / make Schema.derive_track into a call
    The thing is block takes 'BlockId' and track takes (BlockId, TreeNode),
    not CallArgs.  And it doesn't make sense to call from the tracks anyway,
    so maybe not in Scopes.
    Not much point to trying to put it in Environ or Scope since it's
    a different type, but it could be dynamically scoped with the others.
    Basically it's the schema, but dynamically scoped rather than attached to
    blocks.  I can't actually see how dynamic scope makes sense, it should be
    attached to blocks.  So keep it how it is, but call through generator
    cache.
  * I want to do better tests about speed vs. space, cache hits and misses.
    Improve logging so that I can see, given a change, which areas of score
    were rederived.
  Cmd
    - If a msg aborts or doesn't run any cmds, don't bother to run diff.
      Except that hardly ever happens if I do shortcut thru.
    - cache track cmds for each track, update when the track title or skeleton
      changes
  Derive
    AppendList / MergeList for Derive.Stream
      - switch to AppendList and try to get garbage down
        Avoid copying sublists returned by block calls and cache hits
      - play from cursor is a linear scan on all events from the beginning,
        seems like this would be faster if I could skip chunks.
      - see if a Merge constructor can reduce copying
      - can I cache length and range in AppendList?  does it matter?
      - insert parallelism?  maybe the evaluator can do that when it sees
        Merge?
    - lazy signals
      - check out 'at' and 'bsearch' occurrances and see if they can use tails
      - There are lots of lookups in the tempo map
    - see if making a version of Derive.local that's non-monadic in the
      modifier has any effect on performance
    - to get arrival beats to work right with the control track, I think I can
      make the 'set' control track call set from (prev, cur) instead of just
      cur.  It will make simultaneous samples, but they should be ok.
    derive cache
      - c_block should only cache if the block has > a certain number of
        events.
      - implement tracks as generators so they can be cached too
      - I won't rederive cached generators if they have control damage outside
        of the event range.  But there's nothing stopping a generator from
        reading ahead or behind... come up with some kind of solution for this.
    - fair amount of garbage generated by SignalBase.bsearch_above, I think
      this is because it has to box the values when it pulls them out.  But
      it's really just comparing to a Double, so I should be able to do the
      operation unboxed.  But decide about lazy signals before going nuts on
      this.  If I revert to linear search then none of this is necessary.
    - at_linear is called a lot by compose, by compose_warp, by d_warp
      can I make this more efficient?

    - or maybe it's the control deriver creating a huge list of signal
      chunks, which is then all forced at once since merge needs them all.
    - Parallelize derivation with strategies.  Can I spark subderivations?
  Perform
    - use a lazy storeable vector for [Score.Event] and [Midi.Message] to save
      memory?  If I make Messages a storable vector, I'd have to hash the wdev
      or something.
    packed midi, encode to storable vector
      - last step of performer is to compact into vector
      but I'm not sure this will much help
      The main thing is how to encode the device.  I think I can hash it.  Or
      use OS X persistent device ID?
      how many msgs in e.g. the ptrio?
        127130, [pno 9205, flute 63748, clarinet 54177]
        5367 for bloom
        peak for 246114 msgs: 46mb for int, 38.7 for int, 38.7 for w64

symbolic score
  - namespacing?  don't worry about it for now, if I need it later it can be
    entirely at the haskell level, I can use the per-song config to import
    namespaces
  - feta's tr symbol looks bad especially when small, is there a better one?
  - find or make a font with jian ti symbols?
  - find or make a font with gong che pu

fltk:
  - some way to scroll that's not the scroll wheel
  - I could set certain Symbols to stretch to the length of their event, this
    would yield a nicer looking score.  But it would mess up the bounds
    detection.
    * gmail: subject:(scaling text)
      But it's OSX only.
  / implement labels for pitch tracks in fltk/EventTrack.cc
  - skeleton display has leveled steps to make it easier to see who is
    below who.  Only if a track has multiple children.
  - rethrow c++ exceptions as FltkError
  - auto add pitch track when a track title input is expanded crashes with
    assertion error 'title->w() == body->w()'
    solution: text entry is collapsed by track add, remove, or resize
  - factor scroll redrawing into a single class
  / draw arrows in SkeletonDisplay.cc properly meh, they look ok
  - figure out how to have a minimal title bar in os x (win.border(0) removes
    it altogether)
    I can set something like kUtilityWindowClass in Fl_mac.cxx:Fl_X::make, but
    it doesn't get any kbd input
  - can I get the windows into an os x windows menu?
  incremental redraw / scrolling
    I don't like the current situation of incremental redraw and scrolling.
    It's also buggy, i.e. one pixel difference between scroll and redraw.
    Get rid of damage and redraw everything every time.  Then I have to make
    it fast to fetch the data for one screenful.  What makes that slow
    currently?
  draw bugs:
    - redraw after track range damage draws things a pixel too low
    - when scrolling upwards, ruler mark text is not drawn completely
    - doesn't redraw after switching monitors
  Track
    / dividers can have separate color for upper part, for collapsable tracks
  event track
    - visual indication when both solo and mute is on
    - editing event text should use a text entry widget, that way I get
      a cursor, IME, etc.  A side benefit is that I don't have to derive half
      edited data.  This also solves the problem where the currently edited
      event is hidden.

      This only applies to raw edit mode.  Entering notes and doing
      programmatic changes is still single key.

      Remove the separate raw edit mode.  Return while in edit mode creates an
      event if one doesn't exist and begins editing its text.  Keyboard focus
      is then in the widget until return or tab or a click outside of it.

      The responder has to be able to tell UI to open a text entry, so return
      (State, [UiCommand]), where
        data Edit = Edit {
          edit_block_id :: BlockId
          , edit_tracknum :: TrackNum
          , edit_at :: ScoreTime
          , edit_text :: String
          , edit_insert :: Bool
          , edit_selected :: Bool
          }

      If the edit_insert is True and there is already a text entry open at
      that position, insert the given string at the insertion point rather
      than creating a new one.  This can implement midi->*note insertion.

      Return msg is:
        data Edited = Edited BlockId TrackNum ScoreTime String

      The UI can suppress this if it detects the text hasn't changed.

  control track, render signal
    / decided against rendering signal as one long line, comment in
      EventTrack.cc
    - render option: solid with color gradient
    - combine multiple signals, e.g. one controls xpos, one controls color

logview:
  - haskell and c++ use the same machine readable format
  - tabs are not lining up properly
  - option to wrap lines or not?
  - hide or display various attrs: date, file, function, ...

Ui:
  Track
    - benchmark large TrackEvents
    more compact implemnetation than Data.Map?  profile first!
      - priorities: memory efficiency, persistent, merge speed (insert many)
        shallow tree of dense chunks?
        can I take advantage of non-overlap?  [(pos0, data), (pos1, end), ...]
        data Event = Event String StyleId | End | ControlVal Double
      - I think memory efficiency is more important than modification speed
    dense sampled signals
      - efficient storage, preferably as a Signal so no conversion is necessary
      - display dense signals: omit text and trigger lines when zoomed out

plugin host freeze audio
  features:
    3 load synth plugins: ardour3, reaper
    1 programmatically configure them, e.g. load 4 fm8s each with poly of 2
      and loading inst X, or switch them all to inst Y
      - dunno?  can reascript do it?  osc on ardour?
    3 sync play position seq, sync start time
      - I think mmc can do this
      - or maybe the control surface support can do this
    3 start record too
      - control surface support should do this
    2 sync from daw back to seq
      - Can I have the DAW also emit MMC?

  features needed:
    - host synth plugins: programmatically load and configure plugins
    - route midi: associate each plugin with its own midi ports
      It would also be nice to split by midi channel, and route each chan to
      its own plugin.

      On OS X this means creating an IAC port for each synth, presumably
      multiple ones for multiple instances of the synth.  Then I need to
      route each synth to the right midi input and keep them configured.  This
      seems like a bit of a hassle.

      Can I use JACK midi to address a specific synth?  It's one midi stream
      per jack port, so I need an association between insts and jack ports.

    - audio graph config: configure the audio graph, placing synth plugins,
      filter plugins, track record / fader / etc. daw stuff, and outputs
      at various places
    - DAW: Need to sync play position and send current cursor position when
      it changes.
    - track freezer: Record plugin output, sync play position.
  rpc
    - osc, but no good for two way
    - thrift?
  ardour
    - ardour3 supports synth plugins, but doesn't compile on OS X yet
      wait for paul to post his updated build instructions, try again then

  reaper
    it can sync to mmc
    - route multiple plugins to the same bus?  can this be scripted?
      Probably, but to use apple IAC I need to create a bunch of IAC ports and
      make sure they are configured the same way on both sides.
    - can it send cursor position?
      I can poll.

  impromptu
    - mac only
    - can programmatically create a au graph
    ? can it record audio?  yes, but maybe not from an au?
    - in any case, I can't do daw stuff, so I think I don't want this

test:
  - tests count number of tests in addition to checks within each test
  - use generics or Foldable or something to write a generic StructEqual

integrator / midi record:
  - implement

REPL: repl:
  - haskeline sucks for long lines, add multiple line editing?
    really I'd prefer plan9 style esc then edit
  - is Cmd.Lang.Fast now obsolete?
  - can I get local variable bindings (let x = ...; y <- ...) to work in the
    REPL?
  - tab completion for symbols like in ghci
    I'll need a list symbols cmd which the repl automatically sends on tab
    completion.
  - :compile cmd that turns on compilation for everything except Environ
  - :browse to look in modules... can I use GHC.getBindings for this?
  - :module cmd to move evaluation context to a certain module, maybe I
    could also get rid of the need for Cmd.Lang.Environ to import everything.

Cmd:
  * Can I have a general in-place derive cmd for note transformers?
    integrate basically does this
  - step play StepPlay could work even when notes were moved by annotating
    the midi output with the UI event that produced it.  This might be useful
    for debugging too.
  - Can I give Cmds their own state without putting it in Cmd.State every time?
    For instance, twelve scale may want to know what key you're in.
    Actually, it would be best to have per-module state.
    At worst I can have 'Map.Map String Dynamic'.

    Use existentials:
      data forall a. Cmd = Cmd {
        cmd_func :: a -> CmdT (Status, Cmd)
        , cmd_state = a
      }
    This means that such cmds have to be able to be updated after they are run,
    so the cmd lists have to be kept in responder state.  If I'm going to do
    that, why not have cmds optionally return a continuation and handle state
    that way?

      cmd msg = do
        state <- stuff
        return $ continue $ \msg -> do
          more stuff

    Or if I can put it in the monad:
      cmd msg = do
        state <- stuff
        msg2 <- yield Cmd.Done
        more stuff

    For module level, each module of cmds would have to export a bunch of Cmds
    and the responder retrieves the state and passes in another layer of
    StateT, or directly.  I supposed Dynamic wouldn't be so bad for that.  What
    happens when the module is reloaded?

  ? a module with easy access to all GlobalKeymap cmds for cmdline access
  vi style keymap:
    - movement: hjkl, HJKL to move timestep+1 or skip to
      next inst track, bf to move timestep at block section rank, BF to move to
      top and bottom of block
    - esc and i for edit mode
    - number prefixed cmds?  not for now
  Cmd.Edit
    - alternate finale-like note entry: hold down step key to set step and
      turn on edit mode, but only while the key is down
      (merge will clip them to the next event)
    - controller edit mode accepts two numbers and moves on, no spaces
    - a legato command that always goes to the next note would still be useful
   - stretch events in selection to another length (need two selections?)

  Cmd.Language
    - lang cmd stuff to load string serialized tracks for event cut and paste
    - an aux data input for the lang socket might be useful, to paste in data
      without having to quote it
  Cmd.LanguageCmd
    - some way to more easily type IDs, either the mangler adds a let for pbid,
      pvid, etc., or the mangler turns <foo> into <current/foo>

  Cmd.Play
    - play loops
    - start playing from top of displayed area
    - start playing from this block's position in the root block

  Undo
    + incremental save
    - undo as a tree?  On modification, split the undo tree instead of
      throwing away the future.
    - undo only within selection
    - record view changes, at least zoom / scroll so it can be undone / redone
      separately
    - if Cmds have a name return, history entries could have names.  Keymap
      cmds already have a name to put in.

  Cmd.MakeRuler
    - functions to modify zoom levels and other mark attributes
    - functions to splice or delete time or a Meter into a ruler

  Cmd.Freeze
    - details in doc/freeze_track

  Cmd.Save
    - save with a magic number so I can load songs, inst configs, etc.
    - gzip save files

Derive:
  lazy signals:
    - see if I can make control tracks truly lazy by making signals lazy
    - reimplement various functions like integrate and resample, bsearches
      must be linear
    - make linear searches faster for e.g. warp by dropping warp in the past
    - can make integrate output infinite and remove set-prev hack
  instrument
    - per-project short aliases for inst names so you can fit them in tracks
      easily
    - Implement >inst as setting the null call instead of env.instrument.
      That way the inst has control over the interpretation of e.g. attributes
      and pitch slide (to implement piano style retrigger)

      or maybe, lookup val calls in current inst analogous to current scale
      Maybe I can get rid of the Instrument.inst_control_map if I do the
      mapping in generate_note?

  * implement postproc calls
    / framework for determining scope of a postproc: per inst, per track,
      for pre or post overlaps, etc.
    / Think about how to keep incremental recomputation in the presence of
      postproc.  I suppose they have to declare how much they depend on.
    examples of postprocs:
      * echo
      - retune a note depending on the previous interval (e.g. sloppy pitches
        when playing quickly)
      * string emulation:  Every note is assigned a string.  When
        a legato new note is played, it either stops an existing string or takes
        a new one.  The previous note will either ring for a decay if the
        string is unassigned, or reset to its "open" pitch otherwise.  Strings
        can either assume their new pitch instantly (stopped), or gradually
        (bent).
      - overblow emulation: a set of overblow ranges are defined, along with
        possible pitches for each one (fundamental and overblow harmonics).
        When a note moves from one to another, start a new note at the
        destination pitch and bend the decay of the old one to the fundamental
        or closer harmonic from the previous mode.
      - rambat damping emulation: notes ring on by default until they can be
        damped.  Damp at the first opportunity, where opportunity is defined
        as a break with no notes for a certain amount of time.  Can only damp
        two neighboring notes at a time.

  * sustain signal, to control staccato vs. legato
  - to cut the middle out of a pattern: a cut signal that disabled derivation
    when it's 1?
  - combine ornaments, like "hold 1s | tr" to hold the first note for 1 score
    time before starting the trill.  I think this could work by warping tr

  deriver customization
    - set dynamic env vals, especially if a family of derivers use the same
      argument names for analogous behaviour, e.g. 'tr-speed'
    - make it easy to add haskell derivers, tracklang must remain simple
    - derivers call other derivers, which can be rebound

  - test Calls that return overlapping events
  - x = _ will unset x
  - come up with a syntax for Ui.Event preproc calls
    >inst1 | echo < preproc1 < preproc2
  - some kind of notation for replacing the track interpreter, e.g.
    TrackId -> EventDeriver.
    This could be used to implement macros, and also preproc.
  val calls:
    - val calls to get the next/prev TimeStep e.g. trill speed in terms of
      beats.  This means Derive has to have access to the rulers.

  note calls:
    * Implement tick as a call:
      Need to get next and prev Ui.Event, get pitch from pitch sig
      to_local (between (to_gloal prev_pos) (to_gloal next_pos)
      d_absolute_at = d_at . to_local

    - Implement suppress as call:
      This is more tricky, how can a call modify neighbors?  Especially
      preceding ones.  This seems to mean I still need postproc calls:
      DeriveT -> DeriveT.  Internally it evaluates the deriver, processes
      the Score.Events and wraps it in another deriver (the seq equivalent of
      cue).  After that most behaviours are ineffective, but them's the
      breaks I guess.  It seems nicer if I could pass something to the block
      to cause it to skip the downbeat, but how can I do this in a non-ad-hoc
      way?  If I can insert a per-project block deriver I can add it as an arg.

    * Implement tuplet:
      't *n1 *n2 *n3 |' runs deriver three times with three different
      pitches. (Didn't wind up doing it that way.)

    * Implement clip-call:
      Undo the call stretching, this should be efficient because of stretch
      combining:

      d_stretch (recip (dur/block_dur)) $ d_clip dur $ deriver
      "unstretch | sub"

      A non-block call (including notes) will have a block_dur == dur.  I can
      also imagine a version without the clip.  'unstretch' is a crummy name
      though.  'restore'?  'abs-dur'?

    * Implement sekar derivation.
      It would be nice to do a piece on sekar patterns where the form itself is
      in the same pattern, for a kind of fractal structure.  How to have
      a pattern derive patterns?

      - pass the calls as block args
      - put the null deriver in the env
      - more general than the above: dynamically scoped call map and syntax to
        modify it
      - env var that prepends or appends calls to notes.  actually, this is
        better done as a preproc.
      - implement deriver like vla/cello duet?  that's a sekaran, but derived
        from another part.

    * Implement trill
      * absolute tempo version that adds new cycles when stretched
      * version with n cycles that stretches with tempo
      - hybrid where the initial part stretches, final part is absolute

  PitchTrack pitch
    * Named pitch tracks, so derivers (e.g. tuned just scale) can take pitch
      track args.  The way this could work is that the state_pitch becomes
      'Map SignalName PitchSignal' and the "" signal is taken by the note
      deriver during convert.  Track syntax:
      "*scale" -> ("", ScaleId scale)
      "*scale %psig -> ("psig", ScaleId scale)

  ControlTrack control
    interpolators
      - sine
      * constant slope, exp slope (i.e. slope until next control event)
      - continuous tempo warping for signals
        tempo: "2" -> "1", "2", cont: "2" -> "i, 1", should emit a bent line
  Derive.Scale scales
    * implement pengumbang pengisep
    + just intonation tuned to a pitch signal
    - looks like fun: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohlen-Pierce_scale
    - retune a note depending on the previous interval (e.g. sloppy pitches
      when playing quickly)
      I think this has to be postproc.
    - Ratio based notation where the ratios are from the previous pitch.
      Should be able to do this with val calls.
    - parser for scala .scl files

   * Control track management?  It should be possible to have a note or a bunch
     of note tracks with a bunch of control tracks and control the clutter.
     Ideas: collapse has limited usefulness when there are too many, even with
     color coding.  I could do this with logview: selecting a note track logs
     a list of its control tracks and whether they are hidden or not.  Clicking
     on one in logview will emit a cmd that will hide or show that track.
     Or I could use a UI for adding new controls too: click a track, then a cmd
     'add_control "vel"', this will unhide and focus the control if it exists,
     or create a new one and link it with the skeleton if it doesn't.  ^T is
     intended to create new note tracks, and they're only linked to tempo
     initially.

     This implies a slightly more generic and acme-ish system for logview:
     anything enclosed in {}s can be clicked and will be sent verbatim, even if
     it's in the catch line:

     -- title (tracknum): inst_name, allocation, [control tracks]
     Inst (track 1): fm8/inst1, fm8:0,1,2, [vel {hide 2}, pedal {show 3}]

  - set controller within control track?
  * reflect derivation back into a block
  * merge block level changes with derivation

Perform:
  - damper pedal causes all notes to extend until the pedal comes up, should
    the performer know about that?  Is there anything that this breaks?
    I don't think so, it affects channel allotment so notes could be
    improperly joined, but mixing pedal and multiplexing seems rare enough.
  - Perform.Midi.Perform: should be possible to lead keyswitches as long as
    they don't precede the previous NoteOn, since I think samplers will only
    switch on the next NoteOn
  * instruments can have a native scale, so playing that scale won't involve
    pitch bends
  Instrument
    - some kind of organized way to manage instruments and instrument config
    - some basic midi instrument defs for generic midi (dev, patch)
  Midi:
    - see if synths support the set pitchbend range controller
    - Convert certain attrs to controls for cc 'keyswitches'.
    / inst has a notion of polyphony so I can avoid overloading a channel, say
      if I limit it to 2 voices

      The problem is 'allot' doesn't know which channels are going to have
      a lot of notes so it can allot wrong.  For instance, a large chord might
      take up all the polyphony of the first addrs, and then the Nothing addr
      gets the bendy notes.  I think I would have to look into the future and
      make a decision based on the notes that will be overlapping with this
      one.

      The problem comes up with chord oriented instruments that have a few bent
      notes.  However, I'm not totally sure this will be a problem, and it
      would be simpler to simply make two instruments, one for non-bendy notes
      and the other with multiplexing for bendy ones.  Yes, this is putting
      some busywork on the user which should be left to the performer, but
      since the solution is fairly complicated I think I'll leave it be for
      now.

Instrument DB / browser:
  * add my own tags to an instrument
    I need a separate "annotations" db
    Or why not just edit the patch file directly?
  * when merging a sysex inst with a bank file one merge tags too
  - patch files could go in the Local/Instrument dir with the source?
    at least it should go in source control
  - colorize the info_pane so tags are easier to read
  - search lang supports quotes
  * search lang supports ! to exclude a term
  * ability to edit tags, esp. add "favorite rating"
  sysex
    z1
      - convert patches to larger pitch bend and send them back
      - split large sysexes, otherwise initialization wants to send the entire
        dump
      - I need control over which program and bank the patches go when they
        are initialized.  I can use the card as scratch space.
      - I also need to initialize a new multiset, and give the score
        a multiset config, or derive one from the midi config.
    vl1
      - test sending sysexes back
      - move patches to new format
      - figure out how to set category for builtin patches
        *word shorthand for category=word?
        but I want to use the inst name, not the score name...

OSC backend
  osc backend: make up a simple osc reaktor instrument and see if increased
  resolution makes a difference
    . But reaktor doesn't support bundles with times, so if I use it I'd have
      to write my own scheduler.  What about supercollider?
    . OSC: hosc, supercollider: hsc3, hsc3-process
  - Write a simple supercollider instrument and try controlling that with OSC.
  - Even if reaktor and supercollider don't understand bundles, I could write
    a scheduler server that takes bundles and emits their msgs at the correct
    time.
  - Write high-res synthesizer in FAUST, that can be plugged in to a generic
    OSC host.
  - If I have non-realtime synthesis, how do I get the sound to a host?  One
    way is a separate VST that just plays samples.
    The OSC synth can write numerous sound files to a directory, corresponding
    to non-interacting notes, as a cache.  A separate VST monitors the
    directory and starts playing from a certain time on demand.  I can
    communicate the time with either high-res cc, or even pitch bend, or
    song pointer msgs.

jack: JACK:
  bugs
    - something is still wrong, I get "no space in output port" and then
      corrupted output
    ? jack1 doesn't work at all: other clients don't see writes, until I quit,
      and then they get continuously spammed.  Apparently the jack_port_t*
      from the registration and the lookup are different.
      - Try stashing port from port_by_name port instead of jack_register_port.
  - Ensure that shutdown stuff is being called correctly.  I don't care but
    maybe JACK does?
  use jack transport
    I don't think I need to be the master.
    - When starting a play, call jack_transport_locate,
      then jack_transport_start().  The play then blocks on a lock which is
      released by JackSyncCallback when it gets a JackRolling state.
    - Register with jack_set_sync_callback.  JackSyncCallback sets a syncing
      flag, emits a Msg that forces the needed bits of performance, then that
      cmd must call back and reset the flag, at which point the sync function
      can return true.
    Then the next step is to test, and then figure out a way to get ardour to
    automatically set up a bunch of instruments and make MIDI in ports for
    them.

misc ideas:
  - Staff notation represents chords well, but tracks don't.  Think of a more
    compact notation.
  * Staff notation output via lilypond?  This can be implemented as another
    kind of backend.  I think events would need metadata so I have a place to
    put formatting info.  Maybe tracks and blocks need it too so I can express
    staff associations.
  - I could have control calls that modify samples beneath them.  Calls
    starting with '-' are skipped by Args.next, and then they can add multiply
    or whatever to samples.  Oh wait, except they're not in scope, they're
    combined with mconcat.
  - Why can't I write a 'tr' that generates pitch signal in some cases, and
    adds an attribute in others?  It would be redesigning control tracks so
    they are just note tracks that slice their children and apply
    a transformer to them.  I'm not sure that will coexist with the curve
    description language that control tracks currently implement.
    It would be interesting to get rid of track types entirely though.
  - How can I have calls that generate multiple controls, e.g. pitch-dyn track
    to implement fall + decresc?

planning / research
  Composition of score fragments.  I think I want to display subderived
  notes within the call event.  And then some way to put edits on top of it.
  - spline curve interpolator: evoral/Curve.cpp, www.korf.co.uk/spline.pdf

  - If I implement a VST host or patch a DAW to accept VST controls like MIDI
    controls can I get low latency high res controls?
