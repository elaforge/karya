altered state setup to make widgets more independent of sequencer code:
State objects manage their widgets, instead of widgets containing
State objects.  researched transparency for ruler.  small bugfixes to zoom.

placement hacking?  orientation changed to class.  made insert_tracks etc.
reworked state/view a little.

reworked hierarchy so ruler resizing works like it should.  put it back, cuz
the ruler has to be the child of zoom after all.  cleaned up Block
/ Block_view relationship though.  argh, switched it back *again*.  This is
the correct way, though.  ruler scrolls correctly.  zoom still doesn't
work and the ruler spews grayness on its neighbor.

more placement headaches.  fixed zooming and Tile_ext resize behaviour
but there's more gray spooge!  fixed spooge, it was stupid scrollbars again.
thought about how to write Tile_ext some.  current plan is to try to just
override position().  ruler zooming is messed up after a resize.  still
getting extraneous mystery free() error and segfault on exit.  who is fltk
trying to delete?  look in std destructors or see if that pointer is one of
mine.  also put remove_track() in ~Block.

reworked ruler and change overlay_ruler to transparent_ruler, as well as
zoom_info.  transparent_ruler is now per-track.  did some scrollbar stuff,
but not tested.  code still in pieces.  tomorrow I should get things working
and finally see some ruler marks?  track_tile is still resized by track_zoom,
but I think I can have it grow itself on drag.

finally compiles again.  still untested and drawing is broken, but it uses
the new "on demand" event widgets, and Trackpos is its own type now, so it
should be possibly to have superlong tracks with unlimited events and there
will only be widgets for the ones onscreen.  track is still unimplemented,
though.
exhausted after way too much alpha centauri.

Track tile work.  draw() and zoom() seem basically right but the main tile is
really weird (one way dragging).  fixed the extra free() bug.

Reworked and simplified marklist implementation.  Interface and implementation
now cleanly seperated so I can try a plain sorted-array implementation later
if I want.  Ruler draws properly, and zoom seems to work, but ruler scrolling
is messed up.  Also, view->find() implementation should return a copy of the
iterator instead of allowing the client to mutate the internal one, which will
involve less searching around when scrolling.  Tracks are not yet aware of
scrolling or zooming.
I've been rather unfocused lately.

Ack, lossage.  Zoom is reworked yet again, but it's right this time, and
trackpos is truly independent (I think), and it mostly works.  Bugs fixed in
marklist.  Marks display and zoom sort of properly.  Zooming around a point
still doesn't happen quite right, scrollbar jumps, and the scrollbar
gets confused when zooming goes over the marks-disappear threshold... it
shouldn't even know when marks are disappearing.

hzooming works.  vzoming is weirdly messed up.  LOC goes down because
I removed the Transparent silliness, which was totally unnecessary and was
causing spurious events (since they didn't act enough like Fl_Groups by
setting _parent and whatnot).

Finally getting back to work.  Track selections are in but broken.  I'm going
to need to fix that scrolling 'off by one pixel' thing because it makes text
labels look gross.  Marklists are independent per-track / sb / ruler.  Caching
optimization has stubs but isn't implemented yet.
