On further thought, the tracker interface sucks.  Maybe something like a cross
between an event list and a piano roll?  Standard notation is comfortable, and
easy to enter some information with, but I want avoid the 'binary
quantization' (half, quarter, eighth) that and have a more general interface.

Channels of information:
colors, text / symbols, position x y, 

Scale steps are represented by colors of the rainbow, blue is C, up to red as
B, then red C again.  This is advantageous since I imagine it wouldn't be hard
to train oneself to see hotter colors as higher.
