There are three main UI objects: Block, Track, and Event, each contained within
the other.  Blocks and Tracks have a corresponding BlockView and TrackView that
represent the display aspects.  This is so a single Block can have multiple
windows, and a single Track may appear in different blocks.

There is no EventView because the blocks-as-macros functionality should allow
you to put a single event in multiple places already.
