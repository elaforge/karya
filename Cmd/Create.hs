{- | Cmds to create and destroy blocks, views, tracks, and rulers.

    IDs are automatically created from the state_namespace and the other IDs in
    existence.  In general I think it's a bad idea to try to hard to give IDs
    descriptive names because there's nothing keeping them that way.  The
    description should be in the track title.  Even the given numbers will get
    out of date with their position in the block.

    However, I do allow some naming beyond simple numbers for things which are
    unlikely to change, like tempo tracks and rulers, which don't have any
    other title.  And block IDs are used by the sub-derive mechanism, so those
    should be nameable.
