{- | Cmd-level support for integration.  These cmds interpret the output of
    the calls in "Derive.Call.Integrate" to create score from deriver output
    and merge it back into the current score.

    An example of track integration:

    - Add \" | <\" to a note track title, which causes damage and a rederive.

    - Integrate call collects events and puts them into derive results, which
    go into DeriveComplete, which winds up at 'integrate_tracks'.

    - 'integrate_tracks' finds no existing derived tracks, so it merges into
    [], which creates new tracks, and damages the whole block.

    - Then it sets 'Cmd.derive_immediately' on the block, which removes the
    usual derive wait.

    - Derive once again emits integrate results, which winds up at
    'integrate_tracks' again, but since there are no changes this time, there
    is no further damage, and derivation stops.  This additional integration
    just to find out there were no changes is inefficient, but not a big deal
    since it only happens the first time.

    Modify source track:

    - Track damage causes a rederive, which causes the `\<` call to collect
    integrated events.

    - 'integrate_tracks' merges the changes into the destination track (or
    tracks), which damages them.

    - This time when the derive happens, since there was no damage on the
    source track, it gets cached.  The cache intentionally doesn't retain
    integrated events, so `\<` is skipped and I don't get a second derivation.

    Block integration is similar, except that I don't get a double derivation
    when the first new block is created, since the damage is separated to
    a different block.

    It might be a little more orthogonal to omit the thing where
    I automatically create an integrated block or track if there are none, but
    it's convenient in practice.  It does, however, make it tricky to undo
    past the integrate, since if you undo the block\/track creation, the
    integrate call is still there and just creates another.  Be quick!

    This also implements score integration, which is a higher level form of
    integration that simply copies score events directly, without the
    intervening derive step.
