{- | Convert incoming MIDI (and other inputs) to the internal note
    representation.  This has two purposes: note entry, and midi thru.

    This module is, in a way, dual to "Perform.Midi.Perform".  It takes MIDI
    input to the internal 'Input' representation and back again, while Perform
    takes the internal representation, in the form of
    'Perform.Midi.Perform.Event', to MIDI output.

    The overlapping part is that this module maps 'Derive.Score.Control's to
    and from MIDI while Play uses 'Perform.Midi.Control.Control'.  They
    use the same control names, though, so I can reuse code from Control.

    One significant difference between 'Input' and MIDI is that MIDI supports
    two levels of control addressing: note and channel, while 'Input' can
    only represent note addressing through 'NoteId'.  MIDI controls almost
    all apply at the channel level, but of course these controls all apply
    at the note level.  The result is that a MIDI control that on a keyboard
    affects the whole channel will only affect the last played note here.  When
    the input is converted back to MIDI it may wind up sharing a channel
    anyway, at which point the control will go back to being channel global,
    but if the instrument has multiple channels, I try to distribute between
    them to keep note_ids on separate channels.  This way, multiple channel
    emitting controls can be mapped to multiple channel using instruments.

    This is basically a simplified version of the channel allocation algorithm
    in "Perform.Midi.Perform".  It's hard to reuse that algorithm directly
    because this one has to operate in realtime and can't see which controls
    the note is going to use.
