{- | Commands dealing with selection and cursor movement.

    As is typical, when it comes to selecting events, the selection represents
    a half-open range.  However, reflecting the orientation of events,
    a negative event at the start of the range won't be included, and
    a negative event at he end of the range will be included.  This is natural
    for events with negative duration, since they are weighted at the end.

    This behaviour is actually implemented in the low level "Ui.Track"
    functions.

-- * get selection info

{- Getting the selection may seem pretty simple, but there are a number of
    orthogonal flavors:

    - Return a raw Sel.Selection, or return its
    (ViewId, BlockId, TrackId, TrackTime) context.

    - Get a single point from a selection, or a range on a single track, or
    a range of tracks.

    - Get an arbitrary Sel.Num or use the Config.insert_selnum.

    - Return a Maybe or abort on Nothing.

    - Return for any track, or return a TrackId and abort if it's not an event
    track.

    - Used an arbitrary ViewId, BlockId, or use the focused view.

    And then there is a whole other dimension of converting selections, which
    are in TrackTime, to RealTime.  The selection can be converted either
    relative to its block's tempo, or relative to a calling block's tempo,
    namely the root block.

    Also, when a selection is interpreted as a point (for instance, for
    operations like \"play from selection\"), there is a choice of taking the
    point from the beginning of the selection, the end, or the 'sel_cur_pos',
    which is the dragged-to point.  The convention, established by
    'point' and 'point_track', is to take the first point.
