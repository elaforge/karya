{- | This module implements kbd entry by intercepting kbd and MIDI events and
    re-emitting them as InputNotes.  These then go to the track-specific edit
    cmds to enter notes and to "Cmd.MidiThru" which re-emits them as MIDI.

-- * with_note

{- | Take a Key (if @kbd_entry@ is True) or a ReadMessage to a Msg.InputNote
    and pass it to each of @cmds@.  As a minor optimization, @cmd@ is not
    called if no InputNote was produced.

    For the ASCII keyboard, the two rows of keys each map one octave of C to C.
    If the instrument responds to breath control, the key will also emit
    a breath control CC.

    It's a little less graceful than calling it many times applied to a single
    cmd, but only has to convert the input once and doesn't need tricks to make
    sure a converted key winds up with Done.

    Another way to do this would be place this as a transformer at the front of
    the responder, to transform keystrokes and MIDI keys into InputNotes.  That
    way, other Cmds don't have to worry about state_kbd_entry.  However, it
    would either require a privileged position for the transformer, or an
    additional Cmd feature to re-emits a new Msg.  In addition, it would
    preclude the ability to shadow it and catch MIDI msgs for other purposes.
