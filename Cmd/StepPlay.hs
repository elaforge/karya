{- | A non-realtime play.  The idea is to manually step note-by-note.

    This gets the performance for the current block and creates a series of
    MIDI states at each event start which you can then scrub through.

    It uses the starts of the notes in the performance, with a bit of eta
    to account for start randomization.

-- This may be inefficient if the user only wants to play the previous few
-- notes, but it makes rewinding without a limit simple.  Otherwise I have
-- to detect when the selection has moved before the starting point and
-- reinitialize from there.  I'll do that only if this simpler approach has
-- problems.
--
-- This places step points by looking for event edges, within an eta value.
-- Previously, I placed points based on score positions of event starts and
-- ends, but that doesn't work when the events don't line up with the score.
-- This happens with tuplets, or even if events are a bit randomized.
