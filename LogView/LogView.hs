{-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-} -- for pattern type sig in catch
{- | This is a standalone program to monitor the log file.

    It reads lines and streams them to the GUI, which displays them in
    a scrolling box.  Clickable text is surrounded by @{}@s and will be
    highlighted blue in the GUI.  When it's clicked, the GUI sends the tag
    back, much like an HTML href.  For example, stack traces are formatted as
    a REPL cmd that will highlight that location on the score.

    The top line is the status bar, which extracts and remembers bits of
    specially formatted log msgs.  This effectively functions as the app's
    global status bar, since otherwise it has no place for this kind of
    information.  The configuration is 'default_catch_patterns'.

    This also maintains a filter.  The filter is a little language that will
    filter out messages that don't match, documented by
    'Process.compile_filter'.

    In addition, there is a concept of 'Process.CatchPattern's.  These are
    regexes which are matched against msg text.  When one matches, the matched
    groups are kept in a status line.  That way, events reported in the log can
    be collected together.
