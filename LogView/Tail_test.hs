-- TODO
-- The log tail thread sometimes crashes with
-- Posix.getFileStatus: gets openFile: resource busy (file is locked)
-- Presumably this has to do with how the ghc IO manager locks files when
-- opened, but I can't reproduce the problem.  If the problem comes up again I
-- can start with this to try to reproduce.
