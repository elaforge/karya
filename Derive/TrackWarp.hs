    to RealTime and back again, and can be used to create a TempoFunction and

{- | The WarpMap only has TrackWarps for tempo tracks.  But I want to have
    playback cursors on all tracks, and be able to start play from any track.
    So this will extend a TrackWarp of a block or a track to all of its
    children.  This assumes that no one else is fiddling with the Warp.

    Previously I would collect TrackWarps on every track, which is more
    technically correct.  However, due to note inversion, that wounds up
    collecting a TrackWarp for every single note, and just sorting all of the
    stacks was at the top of the profile output.
