scale :: Key
scale = "scale"

seed :: Key
seed = "seed"

srate :: Key

tuning :: Key
tuning = "tuning"

-- | VNum: Separate notes into different voices.  This is used by integrate to

{- NOTE [EnvKey.dynamic_val]
    I originally intended to handle 'Instrument.Pressure' with a note call
    override.  But it turns out that Pressure is also used by Cmd, so I still
    need it.  But to get vel from control functions I have to include the
    ControlValMap in Score.Event.

    I waffled for a long time about whether it was better to handle in the note
    call or in conversion, and initially favored the note call because it feels
    like complexity should go in Derive, which is configurable, and not in
    Convert.  But it turns out doing dyn mapping in Derive then breaks
    integration, so I'd have to undo it for integration.  That made me think
    that this is really a low level MIDI detail and perhaps it's best handled
    by Convert after all.

    A side effect is that NoteOff velocities are now always the same as NoteOn
    ones, since velocity is now a constant sample.  I can revisit this if
    I ever care about NoteOff velocity.

    One problem with doing the dyn conversion here is that for a control
    function on dyn to have any effect I need the value from the control
    function, which means I need a scalar value.  But by the time I get here
    the control functions are already gone.  The note call can't know
    which of the dyn signal or control function is wanted, because that
    decision is made here.  One solution was to put a ControlValMap in
    Score.Event so they get here, but that means that anything that modifies
    controls also has to remember to modify the ControlValMap.  I can do that
    by updating 'Score.modify_control', but it seems like overkill when all
    I really want is to communicate the dyn value.  So instead I stash the
    control function value in 'Controls.dynamic_function'.  Unfortunately this
    brings it's own complications since now I need to remember to modify it
    when I modify an event's dynamic, and filter it out of integration so it
    doesn't create a track for it.

    So neither way is very satisfying, but at least this way doesn't require
    a whole new field in Score.Event.  Perhaps I'll come up with something
    better someday.
