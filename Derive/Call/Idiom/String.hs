{- | Post-process events to play them in a monophonic string-like idiom.

    This tweaks the ends of the pitch signals of notes.  When a new note is
    played, the next event is examined to determine if it will share a string
    or not.

    If the string must be used for the following note, the end of the event is
    bent up to the next pitch before the next event is triggered.  This is
    called the \"attack\".  A fast attack gives the sound of a stopped string,
    a slow one sounds like a bent one.

    If the string won't be used for the following note, it will be released
    after a delay.  The release time determines how long it will take to reach
    its open pitch.  Since the release happens after the note ends, only
    instruments with a bit of decay will have an audible release.

    This does't do anything fancy like simulate hand position or alternate
    fingerings.

    TODO It would be possible to have a polyphonic effect by allowing more than
    one stopped string at a time.
