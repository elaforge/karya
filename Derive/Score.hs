-- event_control_offset is a hack to make moving Events cheap.  Unfortunately
-- it could be error prone because you don't want to look at the untransformed

-- fields big ugly names to encourage the access functions which apply the
-- offset.
--
-- It might be better to provide a wrapper around a TimeVector with an offset
-- built-in, then the untransformed signal could never leak out.  But I don't
-- quite want to duplicate every signal function four times, and it seems silly
-- to give every single signal an offset when only the ones in Event use it,
-- and it's the same for all of them.  Also it turns out to be a bit of
-- a hassle to mess with the signals on events since every time you have to
-- decide if you need transformed on untransformed.
