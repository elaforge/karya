{- | A Symbol is a bit of text enclosed in ``s, such as `sharp`.  When
    rendered, it's turned into a special graphic that may be made up of
    multiple glyphs from different fonts.  The intent is to be able to write
    symbols in plain ascii but have them rendered in an attractive way on the
    score.

    Symbols are rendered at the UI level and are generally static, so instead
    of sending the symbol data over every time I want to draw one, the UI
    level maintains a mapping between symbol names and data on how to render
    them.

    This module is split from "Ui.SymbolC" so importers can avoid
    a C dependency.
