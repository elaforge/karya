This is a place for local additions.

This means local configuration, instruments, Cmds, and the like.  You should
probably put the modules in a package with your name, to avoid name collisions
if anyone ever winds up sharing.

Modules in the `Repl/` directory are included in the REPL's namespace, just
like 'Cmd.Repl.Environ'.
