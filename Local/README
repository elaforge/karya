This is a place for local additions.

This means custom keymaps, custom schemas and derivers, and custom commands.
You should probably put the modules in a package with your name, to avoid
name collisions if anyone ever winds up sharing.

Modules in the Lang/ directory are included in the cmd language's namespace,
just like Cmd.LanguageEnviron.  They're re-imported on each command, so you can
develop commands interactively, but you should compile them when you stop
changing them, to keep command execution from getting too slow.
